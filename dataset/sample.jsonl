{"text": "'Life is too short to hate your job': Lessons from tech's culture crisis\nBeer taps and open offices are overshadowed by shadow workforces and productivity pressure. But can talent pros learn from tech's mistakes?\nAmazon Employees for Climate Justice\nMorgan Fecto\nTwenty years out from the burst of the dot-com bubble, and 15 years after the launch of Facebook, the tech industry narrative has metastasized. Now, banks, hotels, automakers and financial firms all claim to be \"tech\" companies \u2014 and talent pros from all backgrounds have looked to tech when prototyping an organizational culture to attract workers.\nBut recently, beer taps, ball pits, open-office plans and innovation have been overshadowed by shadow workforces, \"stack and rank,\" diversity deficiencies, and harassment allegations. In the past year, workers at Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook have spoken up about their issues with their companies, and leaders have noticed.\n\"We're in this age of people speaking their voices,\" Trisha Degg, VP, talent programs and operations at the Illinois Technology Association (ITA), told HR Dive in an interview. \"People are speaking out more than they ever have in the past. In the dot-com boom, the exposure the common person had was less because you couldn't go online and share.\"\nEven with the cultural erosion identified by many tech workers, talent pros can learn from industry insiders' takes on the tension.\nFrom a talent pro's perspective\nBefore Degg was at the ITA, she worked in recruitment for \"a dot-com company.\" Since then, she's seen a greater emphasis on organizational culture that has changed her profession.\n\"I used to post jobs and never have to hunt for talent,\" she said, \"but the days of posting and praying are over. Companies really have to try harder and talk about their culture because money isn't the only thing that talks anymore \u2014 it's an overall total package.\"\nA few factors contribute to how workers experience tech culture, outsiders perceive it and talent pros can promote it. Chief among them is the challenge of scaling, Degg said.\n\"People are looking to be the next Facebook, but as you build that, staying true to that original culture and vision can be difficult,\" she said. \"You get into this stay-in-your-lane type of thing, and the teamwork and commiserating around the growth \u2014 you lose that when you get bigger.\"\n\"Tech culture\" usually brings to mind long hours, relaxed dress codes and beautiful work campuses. But the cultures of a Facebook-esque startup and a legacy company like IBM are very different, Degg said, and vague culture statements prevent tech recruiters from pitching an accurate vision to prospective hires.\n\"There are some organizations that are lackadaisical about their hours, and others want you to put in the time and be there early, and that's fine if you're a startup trying to build something,\" she said. \"Companies should be aware of what they want their culture to be and define it.\"\nConsidering how hires will be a \"culture add\" can help tech employers, Degg said. So too can acknowledging when culture falls short \u2014 as many say tech has at creating inclusive environments that serve diverse workers.\n\"Perception is reality for your employees,\" she noted. \"You may say you have great inclusion, but I don't believe you can have great diversity if those employees don't feel safe and happy.\"\nFrom a tech workers' perspective\nFor Grant Chinn, a user experience (UX) designer and a steering member of the DC Tech Workers Coalition, a tech job promised stability, the chance to be creative, use of his knowledge of computers and some control over his work.\n\"I'm from the Bay Area in California, so going into tech was just something on our collective radar,\" he explained. When he discovered UX, the idea of helping customers appealed to him. \"That was something I thought I could get behind \u2014 making it easier for the users to use websites and stuff like that.\"\nThe problems Degg identified with scale, however, have affected Chinn's experience of tech work culture. Around the time a past employer went public, Chinn felt an \"unsaid pressure\" to work longer hours to please clients. The resulting \"corporatization\" of the culture, he said, gave him less autonomy in his work. While working on a project he felt personally invested in, Chinn said the pressure seemed worse. Workers in the video game industry and others in \"do what you love\" roles have reported feeling similarly exploited and burned out.\n\"But definitely developers and designers have more privilege because we're not as swamped, and I can speak as a salaried employee; it's more chill and we have more time. We're less in survival mode,\" Chinn added, comparing his experience to that of contract and lower-skill tech workers.\nAs an organizer with TWC at this moment, Chinn has observed an interconnectedness with tech workers' concerns. He said the emergence of one worker movement can galvanize others.\n\"Tech has always been doing bad things. We're just kind of being awakened to it as companies grow larger and get their tendrils in more places,\" he said. \"Learning from the collective movements that are happening \u2014 like with the #MeToo movement \u2014 it's like, 'Hey we can actually do this.'\"\nIf tech workers continue to feel let down by their organizations, Chinn said, their disappointment may spur broader action among tech workers in every role.\n\"I think the movement should consist of contingent workers and basically anyone who works at a tech company \u2014 support people, content moderators. If we're to succeed we'd have to be linked and figuring out how we can all walk out together, if it came to that,\" he said.\nHow can tech course correct?\nLike Degg, Chinn sees the need to include diverse workers and value them as culture adds. To create a culture of inclusivity that will retain diverse talent and heed their concerns, he believes tech needs greater worker participation at the top.\n\"When you get into the company and you see that no one in leadership is a person of color or a woman or gender non-conforming, then they're not going to be standing up for what minority interests are,\" Chinn said. \"So one way to alleviate that is to go past diversity interest groups. Maybe have an elected person from the workers who represents the minority views sit on the board to actually support the interests of workers.\"\nWorker representation on corporate boards, or co-determination, is not a new concept \u2014 in fact, 50% employee representation is required on boards in Germany. Keeping an open ear and mind when workers attempt to unionize, Chinn said, is another way to know what culture changes are necessary to appeal to them.\nStill, the pressure to innovate might always be present in tech. As Degg put it: \"We're constantly going to be trying to disrupt since that's what we've been doing since the beginning of time. If you asked people at the time of Henry Ford what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse not a motorized car.\"\nIf talent pros listen to the tenor of workers' complaints, though, they're often in line with their organization's mission statements \u2014 as with Amazon Employees for Climate Justice's recent appeal to Amazon. \"Our customer obsession requires climate obsession. This necessitates an immediate company-wide plan addressing climate change,\" it said in part.\n\"My perspective for a lot of this stuff, like for the Project Maven protests, is that people were saying, 'This is not what we signed up for,'\" Chinn said. \"What resonated with a lot of people was the Google ethos of 'do no evil' and doing tech for good.\"\nFor talent pros seeking solutions, hearing how workers' causes connect to the organizational mission might help start conversations. Urging other leaders to address the root of the unrest may be a step toward fixing tech's brand of turnover, burnout and disengagement.\n\"I always wanted to sell a product that people wanted to buy as a recruiter,\" Degg said. \"Life is too short to hate your job.\""}
{"text": "The construction industry is well recognized for its perilous work environment. A 2016 report, from the Association ofWorkers\u2019 Compensation Boards of Canada, revealed thatconstruction had the most fatalities, claiming almost one third of the total number across Canadian businesses. As an industry that is continually handling hazardous materials and engaging in challenging situations, it is of utmost importance for both employees and employers to be mindful of workplace health and safety policies and procedures.\nAs a business owner, there are a variety of ways to ensure health and safety measures are being met on the jobsite. For starters, in order to aid in the prevention of workplace accidents and injuries, employers must adhere to the Canada Labour Code (part II), as well as the standards set out in the Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations. This includes the requirement to provide employees with things such as: the necessary information, training and supervision needed to ensure their health and safety while at work; as well as, prescribed safety materials, equipment, devices and clothing, and the knowledge of their use.\nAdditionally, employers are expected to provide the support and resources essential for the operation of policy and work place committees. In fact, as outlined by the Government of Canada, such committees are often referred to as an \u201cinternal responsibility system,\u201d and are required for all federal work places, in order \u201cto assist in protecting the health and safety of employees.\u201d Larger companies, with more than 300 employees, have the added requirement ofestablishing a \u201cpolicy health and safety committee,\u201d in order to better address global issues.\nWhile it is up to up to the employers to help facilitate such committees, it is the responsibly of employees toparticipate in them. After all, while on the job site, employeesneed to take reasonable and necessary precautions to secure their own health and safety, as well as that of those aroundthem, while working. According to the Canada LabourCode (part II), the following are some of the requirements employees must adhere to: use all the safety materials, equipment, devices and clothing provided by their employer;follow all instruction from the employer regarding the health and safety of all employees; and report to their employer, any hazardous thing or circumstance placing individuals in the work place at risk. Consequently, in order to report hazardous items, it is imperative that employees are well aware of the information provided by the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System, otherwise known as, WHMIS. Under regulation 860, it is the employer\u2019s responsibility to collect health and safety information about hazardous materials in their workplace, and pass this information on to their employees. There are three ways this information can be distributed to workers: via the labels on the containers of hazardous materials; through material safety data sheets (MSDSs); and lastly, through employee education programs.\nWhile being cognizant of hazardous materials is a great benefit to employees, both on and off the jobsite, workers also need to acknowledge the safety of their physical workspace. For example, according to the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS), employees must consistently be aware of issues, such as: keeping the work site orderly; properly disposing of scrap, waste and surplus materials; and ventilating all storage areas properly.\nStress is all too common, and is a great contributor to mental health issues. As outlined by the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board of Ontario in their 2006 Basic Certification Training Program: Participant\u2019s Manual, stress can lead one to lose sleep, and/or feel anxious, or reckless, in addition to other indications. When individuals engage in such behaviors they are more likely to make errors in judgment, increase the potential for physical strains and sprains, and become momentarily distracted. As such, it is important to try and reduce one\u2019s stress levels, by following practices such as the ones suggested by CCOHS: take several deep breaths throughout the day; have regular stretch breaks; and organize and prioritize your day.\nAfter all, whether a business owner or laborer, as one tries to cope with all the potential industry stressors on and off the job site, as noted throughout the various policies and procedures, employers and employees must work together to ensure a healthy and safe workplace for all."}
{"text": "Kerala's five year plan and Centre's 15-year plan can co-exist\nIn a seemingly conflicting move, Kerala's newly elected Left Democratic Front (LDF) government has decided to retain its state planning board and continue to follow the five year plan based development strategy.\nThe decision comes at a time when the Central government is thinking of scrapping the five year plans altogether and introduce a 15 year, medium term plan. It has already closed down planning commission and established Niti Aayog, the apex think-tank, in its place. The Niti Aayog, on its part, is working on the 15-year strategy.\nThe Kerala government's move to deviate from the centre's plan can trigger a much larger debate on the state-centre relationship. And by all indications, it will be a healthy one.\nThe Centre's decision to move away from the Nehruvian style of five-year plans to a longer term is not without reasons. First, the increased devolution of funds from the central kitty to the states has made both central government and state governments rework their public expenditure strategies. With lesser amount of funds, Centre will perhaps need to look at programmes and plans that can have a long term impact, and long gestation period. It may cut across states (highway development for instance), or may cut across industries and sectors (like make in India campaign) and hence need long term strategies.\nThe 15-year term also suits Modi government's political game plan to seek a longer tenure through a renewed mandate in the next general elections in the name of completing half-left projects and programmes to make India a \"developed\" country.\nKerala government's decision to retain the five year plan also makes sense for exactly the same reasons. No political party would like to gamble with long term projects in a state, which has been consistently alternating its ruling political formations every five years. The state government would rather like to have a five year frame work (even the planning board's term does not coincide with the government's term) to see that the added allocations that have come through the new devolution are properly utilized for its voters to see.\nThere could be states that will convert their planning boards into Niti Aayog inspired state level arms, and their five-year plans into 15 year plans. However, a blend of long term infrastructure projects, and short term ones, where the former gets more share of central funds and the latter, that of state funds could be a model that could move parallel to the 15-year agenda.\nIt is only when political priorities create hurdles before agencies such as Niti Aayog, one would see asymmetry in planning. Or else, the duration of strategies and plans will not be in the way of development.\nIt shouldn't be.\nLabels: Civil Services"}

This was the first time, in the Rep\u2019s seven Decembers of existence, that a holiday-themed show had been presented in December.\nThe production was directed by the Rep\u2019s Artistic Associate Montgomery Kuklenski (who is now an entertainment executive in Los Angeles). After Cliff Fannin Baker decided to produce a stage version of the Charles Dickens chestnut, Kuklenski read over a dozen versions before selecting one by Tom Markus.\nInstead of taking place on the Rep\u2019s stage, the production was mounted in the university theatre on the UALR campus. (With a cast of nearly 40 actors and many special effects, it would have been difficult to produce this at the Rep\u2019s home adjacent to MacArthur Park.)\nScott Edmonds played the title character with other parts being played by Dallas Miles, Jonathan Michaelson, Rebeccas Wilenski, Charles Hatchock, Larry Edwards, Peter White, Jay Kinney, Tommy Cherepski, Ted Eades, and Ronald J. Aulgur.\nOne of the reasons that the Markus version was selected was that it incorporated numerous Christmas carols into the script both as part of the action and as transitions between scenes. Sharon Douglas served as pianist and music director for the production.\nThe production ran from December 9 through 18 of 1982.\nSeveral of the actors were captured in Mark Hughes\u2019s costumes by Andrew Kilgore as part of his multi-season Developing Character black and white photo portrait series.

Cheney\u2019s time in D.C. was marked by treason against her own party. She joined a handful of Republicans to attack former President Trump. But she went farther than most, helping Pelosi frame him as an enemy of the country.\nThe folks back home rewarded her with a swift kick out the door. But don\u2019t feel sorry for her. As she leaves Congress, it has been revealed just how much she profited from \u201cserving\u201d the public. In reality, she served herself, a shocking increase in personal wealth.\nRep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) will vacate her congressional seat on Tuesday after becoming a wealthy woman during her six years of serving Wyoming\u2026\nBreitbart News reported in August that Cheney\u2019s net worth ballooned from an estimated $7 million when she first took office in 2017 to possibly more than $44 million in 2020. Depending on the specifics of her latest financial disclosure form, Cheney\u2019s net worth could have skyrocketed up to 600 percent in Congress.\nThat\u2019ll turn your stomach. After six years in public office, Liz Cheney became even more wealthy than she was before she was elected.

(Joe Raedle / Getty Images / South Florida Sun-Sentinel)\nFloridians are well-aware of the acute environmental and health problems of harmful algal blooms and they are looking to their political representatives to take action.\nThe causes of HABs are no mystery: expanding residential and commercial development and agri-business \u2014 particularly cattle, poultry and the dairy industry \u2014 contribute to the increasing flow of nitrogen and phosphorus that spawn HABs in Lake Okeechobee and on the east and west coasts. And as our state\u2019s population continues to swell there are increased burdens on water treatment plants and septic systems.\nMedia reports of fouled beaches, fish kills, and the stench of HABs are not good for tourism \u2014 about 10% of Florida\u2019s economy. But even more concerning, our health is at risk.\nGov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 Blue-Green Algae Task Force made several sensible recommendations, though some of the Task Force\u2019s recommendations could have gone further. Several of the recommendations are the basis for reforms incorporated into Senate Bill 712, now before the Legislature. Of concern is whether the Legislature and the Governor will provide the funding and teeth behind the recommendations to ensure that they will be effective.\nHoward L. Simon is the retired Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida. He is now Director of the Clean Okeechobee Waters Foundation. (Courtesy / Courtesy)\nThe State has given $650,000 to four Florida universities to research the impact of HABs on public health, which is a step in the right direction. Actions to prevent HABs, however, will require much greater expenditures.\nThe Department of Health, which is responsible for the health of Floridians, rightly posts warnings about the acute dangers to humans and animals of swimming where there are HABs. But for too long the Department has stated that 'there is no proven connection between cyanobacteria and ALS', and that 'the BMAA hypothesis is still a hypothesis'.\"\nWalter Bradley is former chairman of the University of Miami Department of Neurology and an expert in ALS. He has researched environmental causes of ALS (Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease), including exposure to cyanobacteria, for more than 15 years. (Courtesy of Dr. Walter Bradley)\nThis failure to act on evidence presented by mounting scientific research is placing the long-term health of Floridians at risk.\nIt is not new information that the cyanotoxin microcystin, produced by blue-green algae, affects the liver. A scientific paper published in 2015 linked the distribution of chronic non-alcoholic liver disease in the United States to locations of cyanobacteria blooms.\nPapers published in 2004 showed that another cyanotoxin produced by HABs, BMAA, was the likely cause of the chronic epidemic of ALS (Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease), dementia and Parkinsonism in Guam. New evidence in papers published since 2016 has shown that feeding BMAA to animals can produce neuropathological changes like Alzheimer\u2019s disease and ALS. More recently, BMAA and the neuropathological changes of Alzheimer\u2019s disease have been reported in the brains of beached dolphins in Florida waters contaminated by HABs.\nIt may take 20-plus years for a chronic neurotoxin like BMAA to produce Lou Gehrig\u2019s or Alzheimer\u2019s disease in humans. Does that put us where we were with smoking in the 1950s? Though people long suspected that smoking was harmful to health, it took decades to prove that smoking caused lung cancer -- and to persuade people to quit. But we didn\u2019t wait until \u201call the data was in\u201d before the first Surgeon General Warnings were issued in 1964.\nOf course, more research on HABs and BMAA is needed. For example, we need to know how much exposure to HAB-infested water is too dangerous? But there are enough studies to warrant taking action now, including warning the public that exposure to HABs is to be avoided and for lawmakers to enact policies to stem the flow of nutrients that cause algae blooms.\nVoting for Trump\u2019s election lies may cost Rick Scott dearly | Steve Bousquet\nThe violence and conspiracy theories Trump fueled will remain when he\u2019s gone | Opinion\nBuckle up.

{"text": "What is the Value of Propeller Balancing?\nWe all want to enjoy a smooth, comfortable flying experience. But all too often, excess and unwanted vibration can make flying downright unpleasant for pilots and passengers. Not only is vibration noisy and disruptive, but it can also cause extensive damage that drives up maintenance costs. Excess vibration may put stress on just about every part of an aircraft, including the airframe, engine accessories, and even the avionics equipment.\nEven if you don\u2019t feel or hear vibration while flying, your aircraft propeller could still be out of balance. Check for wear and tear around the propeller assembly, including cracks in the spinner dome, loose rivets, or cracks in the aircraft cowling. If you notice any of these signs, it\u2019s time to have a professional maintenance technician take a look.\nIt\u2019s important to note the difference between static and dynamic propeller balancing. All propellers come from the factory statically balanced. A static balance is also routinely performed during overhaul services. Statically balancing a prop ensures that one blade doesn\u2019t weigh more than another. But once it is mounted and installed on the aircraft, even a well-balanced prop can become offset. In addition to static balancing, most propellers benefit from dynamic balancing.\nDynamic balancing is the process of measuring the vibration of the entire propeller and engine assembly while it is in operation. To do this, accelerometer sensors are attached to the engine, and then the aircraft is started and brought to full power. The sensors analyze the vibration magnitude of the propeller and engine in inches per second. A small optical tachometer is also used to measure the RPM of the engine and the movement of the propeller. This allows propeller technicians to identify the angle at which the imbalance exists so they can add a small amount of weight to correct the imbalance. The test is repeated until the level of vibration is found acceptable by the technician. Ideally, the process of dynamic balancing will reduce vibration to within 0.07 inches per second.\nOverall, dynamic balancing is a smart move to protect the health and longevity of your aircraft propeller, engine, airframe, and avionics. It can also give you and your passengers a smoother, more comfortable flight. After a dynamic propeller balance, many pilots say they feel as if they are flying a completely different airplane.\nThe best time to have your propeller dynamically balanced is after an overhaul or propeller replacement. Any time your prop is removed, it\u2019s a good idea to have it rebalanced. But keep in mind, not all prop shops have the specialized equipment, tools or training needed to perform quality dynamic balancing. Be sure to do your research before choosing a shop to service your propeller. At Hartzell, we\u2019ve assembled a global network of Recommended Service Facilities (RSF) that have met our high standards for quality and safety. To find your nearest RSF, click here."}

Are they still good?\nThe KJV translates Strongs H5647 in the following manner: serve (227x), do (15x), till (9x), servant (5x), work (5x), worshippers (5x), service (4x), dress (2x), labour (2x), ear (2x), misc (14x).\nWhy did the KJV translators choose the word \u2019till\u2019 those 9 times? Instead of \u2018serve\u2019?\nI don\u2019t have definitive answers here, but I will leave you with a quote from \u2018Chief Two Eagles\u2019 (pic at bottom right) which pretty much (except for a bit of hyperbole) sums up my view of North America about the time the KJV was produced (1611) \u2026 link to larger version HERE.\nAnd I hope you will consider the words of Toby Hemenway, a keynote speaker at the recent Permaculture Voices conference, on the subject of English agriculture \u2013 tillage \u2013 summarized neatly in a list at top left.

You can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\nCrawling inside the head of translators and editors of versions of the Bible can be a tricky business. So, I try to follow the principle of letting the Bible interpret the Bible. As you mentioned, the significant difference in the number of times aw-bad is used to mean serve and its other translations is a pretty good indicator. However, I will also admit that it\u2019s no guarantee that in the early Genesis usage, it means serve. But, I feel pretty good about accepting that it means serve in the Genesis usage because of the overall nature of God\u2019s creation and Adam\u2019s role therein.\nSome would claim the agricultural context would determine that it meant till. But, even Adam\u2019s care of the garden and then growing food in a post-fall setting didn\u2019t include tilling as 17th Centrury minds would have understood it.\nI am tempted to claim that the 17th Century mind would have logically translated aw-bad as till in the early Genesis usage because of the nature of society and how agrarian humans had become. Largely I claim this because how Adam and his son husbanded the ground was not the same as the agricultural practices of the farmers of King James\u2019 era.\nI also think of what is more like God\u2019s nature in His mercy and provision for us? Yes, in a post-fall curse, we are enslaved to work to produce for our living. But, what would have God\u2019s creation been like for Adam if they had not sinned? Do we think it is more in line with God\u2019s nature to have a creation where we were in a servant relationship with the land modeled after our servant relationship with Him? Or do we think it is more like God to create Eden and want Adam to toil in it? I suggest the former. And it is my limited understanding of God\u2019s nature that reinforces my choice to view aw-bad in early Genesis usage to mean serve, just as it does more than 200 times in the rest of scripture.\nFinally, I understand Hebrew to be less literal than English and the Hebrew mind thinks and communicates more in images than literal discription. So, for the Hebrew, the picture of man serving the ground is more likely than man tilling the ground.\nIs all this definitive? I can\u2019t claim it to be. But, I can rest easy in my decision to view aw-bad to mean serve based on the evidence."}

Mont St Jean became a place of suffering and endurance. It\u2019s possible that as many as 6000 casualties passed through the place. Many men died there.\n\u201cThe site has never been excavated before. As an archaeologist this is a unique opportunity to look for evidence of the battle to save lives\u201d.\nWaterloo Uncovered combines world-class archaeology with a programme of care and recovery. Many of the military personnel involved have experienced service-related wounds and injuries, or suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Taking part on the Dig can help people rebuild health and confidence, learn new skills and interests and give them the chance to mix with people from a variety of backgrounds.\n\u201cIt will be thought-provoking and moving to be excavating on the site of the Field Hospital. Some of our team have themselves, experienced battlefield first aid.\u201d Says Mark Evans, Chief Executive of Waterloo Uncovered. \u201cThe men of 1815 would have hoped for very little. Many of those who survived returned to an uncertain future because of their injuries. The care and recovery process has changed so much today. Waterloo Uncovered plays its part by offering a nine-month programme of support. The Dig is just the beginning\u201d.\nThe Waterloo Uncovered team comprises a mix of nationalities. Dutch military veterans will once again be working in the trenches this year, reflecting the important role played by the Duke of Wellington\u2019s Dutch allies during the battle.\n\u201cThe Battle of Waterloo changed the face of Europe\u201d says Colonel Ludy de Vos of the Dutch Veterans\u2019 Institute, \u201cWe\u2019re delighted for Dutch military personnel to be standing alongside British and international colleagues at a site so important to European history.\"\nWaterloo Uncovered has been excavating areas of the battlefield since 2015. In that time they have made important new discoveries about the intense and bloody fighting and about the men who took part in the battle.\nThis year\u2019s dig is sponsored by Annington, one of the UK\u2019s largest providers of privately rented property and a specialist in providing property for the Ministry of Defence.\nWaterloo Uncovered will be excavating at Waterloo from 9 to 19 July 2019.\nWaterloo Uncovered is a charity created to carry out archaeological work across the Waterloo Battlefield and in the process support veterans and serving military personnel with their recovery, education and transition to civilian life.\nThe charity was founded by Mark Evans and fellow Coldstream Guards officer Charlie Foinette, Both men had studied archaeology before joining the army and serving in Afghanistan. Their frontline service convinced them that getting veterans involved in archaeology could be a useful way to help them along the road to recovery and wellbeing.\nWaterloo Uncovered is comprised of five partner organisations: The Centre for Battlefield Archaeology at the University of Glasgow, L-P Archaeology, Service Public de Wallonie, Ghent University and University College Roosevelt/University of Utrecht.\nYou can follow the progress of the dig via Waterloo Uncovered Twitter or Facebook accounts.\n<< University news\n<< previous story"}
{"text": "Thanks and credit go to Vinny Swendsen for contributing this article. Vinny is a North Carolina resident and an owner of a Zero SR electric motorcycle.\nWhile electric vehicles of the four wheeled variant seem to make most of the headlines today, electric motorcycles are slowly gaining in popularity. Electric motorcycles offer many of the same benefits as owning an electric car and also face many of the same challenges. But the two wheeled world clearly has a different view of the electric motor and battery pack that is at the heart of an electric motorcycle. The environmental benefits so frequently touted with four wheeled electric vehicles takes a back seat to the performance aspects of an electric motor when you are talking to the two wheeled world. Automatic transmissions so common in today\u2019s cars are extremely rare in motorcycles. Motorcyclists expect to use a clutch and to shift gears! But electric motorcycles are direct drive and use a belt or chain to transfer power from the motor to the drive wheel. No shifting makes the electric motorcycle ideal for commuting. With the electric motor producing \u201call the torque all the time\u201d the electric motorcyclist never has to worry about what gear they are in or what RPM their engine is running at. This means they can focus more on the traffic around them and how best to assess and respond to inattentive drivers. The direct drive feature of the electric motor also makes the electric motorcycle ideal for people who are interested in a motorcycle, but find using the left handed clutch and left foot shifting of a gas powered motorcycle a bit intimidating.\nTeam Power Sports of Raleigh and Motorcycles of Charlotte are two local motorcycle dealers who sell the Zero brand of electric motorcycles. Zero Motorcycles is based out of Scotts Valley, California and is the largest manufacturer of electric motorcycles in the U.S. Not only does Zero sell motorcycles designed for street and off-road use to the general public, but Zero also offers a law enforcement version of their dual sport motorcycle and a military version of their off-road motorcycle.\nThe Zero SR is Zero\u2019s top of the line model for 2015. The Zero SR comes with a 50kW motor and a 15.3 kWh battery (with optional 2.8 kWh Power Tank) giving the SR a range of 185 miles in the city or 115 miles on the highway. Charging the SR\u2019s battery pack is done with an internal 1300 watt charger that plugs into a standard household outlet and can take up to ten and a half hours to charge. Zero offers quick chargers to speed things up a bit, and there are aftermarket chargers available as well. By using two 2,500 watt Elcon chargers and the Zero\u2019s internal charger, a rider can fully charge the Zero\u2019s battery pack in under two hours using a level two charging system. The Zero SR can go from 0-60 mph in under four seconds and has a top speed of 102 mph. But this performance comes at a cost and the base Zero SR is listed at $17,345.00. The Power Tank equipped Zero SR is listed at $19,840.00. Start buying extra chargers and the price climbs quickly.\nBut electric motorcycles aren\u2019t just for commuters looking for an easier way to ride to work. Lightening Motorcycles is producing their LS-218 electric motorcycle with a 150 kw motor (200 HP) and up to a 20 kwh battery. The LS-218 is so named for its 218 mph top speed at Bonneville on 2011. In 2013, the Lightening electric motorcycle beat all gas powered motorcycles in the Pikes Peak Hill Climb Challenge by 21 seconds! Mission Motorcycles is also designing an electric motorcycle with a 120 kw motor and up to 17 kwh battery pack capable of 0-60 mph in under three seconds. With performance numbers like these, electric motorcycles can meet the needs of the most demanding sport bike rider.\nElectric motorcycles, like their four wheeled counterparts are slowly becoming more accepted and more commonplace. Harley Davidson has been taking their prototype electric motorcycle called Project Live Wire on the road this year giving many motorcycle enthusiasts their first chance to ride an electric motorcycle. Getting people to try electric vehicles no matter how many wheels they have is important to their acceptance. Riding a motorcycle has never been easier than when it is equipped with an electric motor, so perhaps now is a great time to give your four wheeled electric car a two wheeled electric companion!"}

(Twitter)\nRussian investigators believe a couple may have killed, skinned, and eaten up to 30 people over the past two decades, even secretly feeding \"canned human meat\" to unsuspecting soldiers at the military academy where they worked, the Washington Post reports. According to the Moscow Times, a construction worker in the city of Krasnodar found a cellphone Sept. 11 that contained gruesome images: a man taking a selfie with a severed hand in his mouth, severed heads, and dismembered women. Authorities say police traced the phone's SIM card to 35-year-old Dmitry Baksheev, who initially claimed he found the body parts in a dumpster and took pictures with them. He allegedly later confessed that he and his wife had killed and eaten perhaps 30 people, which would put them among Russia's worst serial killers.\nWhile many details of the case are unknown or unconfirmed, authorities say the alleged murders date back to at least 1999, CNN reports. That's the time stamp on a photo found in the couple's home that appears to show a severed head and fruit on a serving plate. Authorities say they also found eight body parts preserved in jars with saline solution, the remains of seven people, and a how-to video on cannibalism in the couple's apartment. According to the BBC, \"food fragments and frozen meat pieces of unknown origin\" found in the apartment are being tested for human DNA. Authorities say Baksheev and his wife, Natalia Baksheeva, would knock their victims out with sedatives, though it's unclear how they chose their victims. So far authorities have only charged Baksheev with a single count of murder. (Read more cannibalism stories.)"}

A month earlier, the idea of lockdown was unthinkable, but now it seemed like it could happen, at any moment.\nA thin, wise-looking bearded man with Freud-style glasses sat down across from me, having just left the studio. He was there to catch his breath following his interview but he looked deeply troubled.\n\u201cThere is fear in the air,\u201d I said, breaking the silence.\n\u201cMadness is all around us. The public is adopting a personality disorder I\u2019ve been treating my whole career.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it that you do?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m a practicing psychiatrist who specializes in anxiety disorders, paranoid delusions, and irrational fear. I\u2019ve been treating this in individuals as a specialist. It\u2019s hard enough to contain these problems in normal times. What\u2019s happening now is a spread of this serious medical condition to the whole population. It can happen with anything but here we see a primal fear of disease turning into mass panic. It seems almost deliberate. It is tragic. Once this starts, it could take years to repair the psychological damage.\u201d\nI sat there a bit stunned, partially because speaking in such apocalyptic terms was new in those days, and because of the certitude of his opinion. Underlying his brief comments were a presumption that there was nothing particularly unusual about this virus. We\u2019ve evolved with them, and learned to treat them with calm and professionalism. What distinguished the current moment, he was suggesting, was not the virus but the unleashing of a kind of public madness.\nI was an early skeptic of the we-are-all-going-to-die narrative. But even I was unsure if he was correct that the real problem was not physical but mental. In those days, even I was cautious about shaking hands and carrying around sanitizer. I learned later, of course, that plenty of medical professionals had been trying to calm people down for weeks, urging the normal functioning of society rather than panic. It took weeks however even for me to realize that he was right: the main threat society faced was a psychological condition.\nI should have immediately turned to a book that captivated me in high school. It is Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds by Charles Mackay (1841). I liked reading it because, while it highlighted human folly, it also seemed to indicate that we as a civilization are over that period in history.\nIt allowed me to laugh at how ridiculous people were in the past, with sudden panics over long hair and beards, jewelry, witches, the devil, prophecies and sorcery, disease and cures, land speculation, tulips, just about anything. In a surprising number of cases he details, disease plays a role, usually as evidence of a malicious force operating in the world. Once fear reaches a certain threshold, normalcy, rationality, morality, and decency fade and are replaced by shocking stupidity and cruelty.\nIn reading the history of nations, we find that, like individuals, they have their whims and their peculiarities; their seasons of excitement and recklessness, when they care not what they do. We find that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object, and go mad in its pursuit; that millions of people become simultaneously impressed with one delusion, and run after it, till their attention is caught by some new folly more captivating than the first. We see one nation suddenly seized, from its highest to its lowest members, with a fierce desire of military glory; another as suddenly becoming crazed upon a religious scruple; and neither of them recovering its senses until it has shed rivers of blood and sowed a harvest of groans and tears, to be reaped by its posterity\u2026. Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.\nAfter 2005 when the Internet developed into a serious repository for human knowledge, and it became accessible via smartphones and near-universal access, I too was tempted by the idea that we would enter into a new age of enlightenment in which mass frenzies would be quickly stopped by dawning wisdom.\nYou can see evidence of my naivete with my April 5, 2020 article: With Knowledge Comes Calm, Rationality, and, Possibly, Openness. My thought then was that the evidence of the extremely discriminatory impact of the virus on plus-70 people with underlying conditions would cause a sudden realization that this virus was behaving like a normal virus. We were not all going to die. We would use rationality and reopen. I recall writing that with a sense of confidence that the media would report the new study and the panic would end.\nI was preposterously wrong, along with my four-month-old feeling that all of this stuff would stop on Monday. The psychiatrist I met in New York was correct: the drug of fear had already invaded the public mind. Once there, it takes a very long time to recover. This is made far worse by politics, which has only fed the beast of fear. This is the most politicized disease in history, and doing so has done nothing to help manage it and much to make it all vastly worse.\nWe\u2019ve learned throughout this ordeal that despite our technology, our knowledge, our history of building prosperity and peace, we are no smarter than our ancestors and, by some measures, not as smart as our parents and grandparents. The experience with COVID has caused a mass reversion to the superstitions and panics that sporadically defined the human experience of ages past.\nEventually, people have and do come to their senses, but it is as Mackay said: people \u201cgo mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.\u201d\nJeffrey A.

We were fortunate enough to have a small game development program, and that is where I was exposed to programming.\nIn Highschool I didn\u2019t use very many dev tools, just programmed in Java. Now I used Unity, UE4, and I program in C#, Java, C++, C. Programming is fun.\nOur game uses a lot of physics. Our tether between the players interacts with almost all the objects in the game. So when we decided to make the game direct connect multiplayer on the PC we had some pretty big hurdles to jump through. Getting a lot of physics to sync up can be a pain!\nWe joke a lot about what is next, but for right now we are focused on making a good game.\nI worked on \u2018Tacopocalypse\u2019 with Cherry Pie Games and together we have made a few apps. We also like to prototype a lot.\nI guess I have to say that my favorite console was the original Playstation. It was my first console, and I loved it. But before consoles, I was playing on the PC. I\u2019m not sure what kind of computer we had, but it ran Windows 95!\nOh man, this is tough. I would have to say it probably isn\u2019t the worst game I\u2019ve ever played \u2026 but the mostdisappointing game I\u2019ve ever played was Spore.

{"text": "Is TEC missing opportunity?\nOne of the things I hoped to bring to the TSA in 2016 was my experience with UK Public Transport. Industry bodies like Urban Traffic Management and Control Development Group (UDG) helped the industry determine interoperability from the screens on the streets, the ticket machines on the buses and the Central Office integrating with traffic lights and variable message signs. There was even a standard so that competitors could agree where a bus stop was (NAPTAN).\nThese protocols had some big impacts- Local Authorities could buy the best of breed of each component in the expectation that when it was all put together, it would work. This was especially important for smaller Authorities who perhaps didn\u2019t have the inhouse technical expertise. It also meant that new entrants could launch innovative new products quickly into an accepting market if they met the standard. The result was an explosion in Smart City projects that were on a larger scale than could have originally been envisioned. Everyone benefited from a larger slice of a bigger pie.\nIn Technology Enabled Care (TEC) that goal feels as far away as ever as Paul Shead of Enovation pointed out this week https://www.tsa-voice.org.uk/news_and_views/blog/open-for-business/. The TEC industry still seems to be dominated by the idea that by hobbling interoperability, each supplier will be able to force the customer to buy complete systems from them and thereby keep the competition at bay.\nTo do so misses the point of Industry 4.0 and the largest change in industrial thinking in the last 13 years. When Apple brought out their phone it was dismissed by some people from Ericsson as not a very good phone. Nokia at the time had over half the worlds mobile sales. Apple killed them both because it offered an open platform to hundreds then hundreds of thousands of developers. It stopped being a phone and started being a mobile computer with almost limitless possibilities. Nokia tried to compete but inhouse development can only do so much. They could never match the innovation, the interaction, the sheer scale of the App Development Community. Being open took Apple from a niche computer maker to arguably the most valuable company in the world.\nMobius sees that change in thinking being played out in other sectors we are involved in- from the rise of standards such as EMV in the Credit Card industry or SCOOT in UTMC- interoperability is an industry's best chance of delivering what its customers want and thereby growing quickly. Open platforms de-risks, drives down costs and drives up adoption. In TEC, Mobius can help bridge the gap, using our Interoperability Platform we can highlight where differences occur and provide independent network analysis to smooth the integration between platforms. But we shouldn\u2019t have to.\nFor more information about how Mobius can help you build an interoperable digital TEC scheme please contact us at juliem@mobiusnetworks.co.uk or call us on +44 1530 511 180\nWritten by Douglas Gilmour\nCelsius: works seamlessly"}

Such a society is of pontifical, patriarchal or eparchial law, in accordance with the norm of can. 505, \u00a7 2; it is clerical, according to the norm of can. 505, \u00a7 3; dependent on the ecclesiastical authority as congregations are, in accordance with the norm of cann. 413 \u2013 415, 419, 420, \u00a7 3 and with due regard to particular law established by the Apostolic See, can.418,\u00a7 2.\n\u00a7 3. Members of these societies are equivalent to religious in what pertains to the canonical effects unless the law provides otherwise or it is apparent from the nature of the matter.\nAll members of these societies are subject to the Roman Pontiff as their supreme superior, to whom they are obliged also in virtue of the sacred bond of obedience.\nIn respect to the erection and suppression of a society and of its provinces or houses, the same prescriptions as those established for congregations in cann. 506 \u2013 510 are to be applied.\nThe mode of governance is to be defined by the statutes of the society. In all, however, the norms of cann. 442 and 511 \u2013 515 on congregations shall be applied, unless this is against the nature of the matter.\n\u00a7 1. The society, its provinces and houses, lawfully erected, are by the law itself juridical persons according to the norm of can. 423.\n\u00a7 2. The administration of goods shall be governed by the prescriptions of cann. 424, 425 and 516.\n\u00a7 3. Whatever members acquire in respect to the society is acquired for the society; other property the members retain, acquire and administer in conformity with the statutes.\n\u00a7 1. The statutes shall be observed regarding the admission of candidates in the society with due regard for cann. 450 and 451.\n\u00a7 2. The statutes shall be observed in respect to the formation of members, but in respect to the formation of members who are destined for holy orders the canons on the formation of clerics are to be followed.\n\u00a7 1. In accordance with the norm of the statutes, the major superior of a society can issue dimissorial letters for holy orders to be conferred on perpetually incorporated members; these letters are to be sent to the bishop mentioned in can. 537, \u00a7 2.\n\u00a7 2. A perpetually incorporated member is ascribed as a cleric to the society by diaconal ordination or, in the case of a cleric already ascribed to an eparchy, by perpetual incorporation.\nThe members of a society are bound by the obligations which are prescribed for clerics by common law, unless the law provides otherwise or it is otherwise certain from the nature of the matter, without prejudice to the rights and obligations determined in the statutes.\nSECULAR INSTITUTES\n\u00a7 1. In the case of transfer to another society of living in common according to the manner of religious or to a religious institute, the consent is required of the superior general of the society from which the transfer is being made and, if it is in regard to a transfer to a society of another Church sui iuris, also the consent of the Apostolic See.\n\u00a7 2. A member who moves to another religious institute must go through the entire novitiate and is equivalent to other novices of the institute; with respect to profession, the statutes of the new institute are to be followed.\n\u00a7 3. Without prejudice to cann. 497 and 498, in order to dismiss a member after perpetual incorporation, the superior general is competent, observing cann. 500 \u2013 503, but a temporarily incorporated member is dismissed in accordance with can. 552.\n\u00a7 4. It shall be determined in the statutes of the society the authority who is to dispense from the sacred bond.\nCan 563\n\u00a7 1. A secular institute is a society in which the members:\n1\u00b0 tend to achieve a total dedication of themselves to God by professing the three evangelical counsels according to the statutes, their profession being confirmed by some sacred bond recognized by the Church;\n2\u00b0 exercise some apostolic activity in the manner of leaven in the world and out of the world so as to imbue everything with the spirit of the gospel for the strengthening and increase of the Body of Christ;\n3\u00b0 do not imitate the manner of life of religious, but lead a life of communion among themselves according to their statutes;\n4\u00b0 clerics or lay people, in respect to all canonical effects, remain each in their own state.\n\u00a7 2. Secular institutes are of pontifical, patriarchal or eparchial law, in accordance with can. 505, \u00a7 2.\nThe members of the secular institutes are subject to the Roman Pontiff as their supreme superior, whom they are obliged to obey also in virtue of the sacred bond of obedience.\nA member of a secular institute is ascribed as a cleric in virtue of diaconal ordination in the eparchy for whose service he was ordained, unless he is ascribed to the institute in virtue of a concession of the Apostolic See, or, if it is a secular institute of patriarchal law, of the patriarch.\nRegarding the erection and suppression of secular institutes, their statutes as well as their dependence on ecclesiastical authority cann. 414, 506, 507, \u00a7 2, 509 and 510 on congregations shall be observed.\n\u00a7 1. The secular institutes, their provinces and houses, lawfully erected, are ipso iure juridical persons, according to the norm of can. 423.\n\u00a7 2. The administration of goods is governed by cann. 424 and 425.\n\u00a71. In admitting candidates, the statutes are to be observed with due regard for can. 450.\n\u00a7 2. A perpetually incorporated member of a secular institute is dismissed by a decree issued in accordance with the statutes; however the decree cannot be executed unless it is approved by the eparchial bishop or by the competent higher ecclesiastical authority; it is up to the same eparchial bishop or authority also to dissolve the sacred bond.\nIt is reserved to the particular law of each Church sui iuris to enact more detailed norms concerning secular institutes.\nOTHER FORMS OF CONSECRATED LIFE\nAND SOCIETIES OF APOSTOLIC LIFE\nParticular law can establish other kinds of ascetics who imitate eremitical life, belonging or not to an institute of consecrated life. Consecrated virgins and widows who live on their own in the world, having publicly professed chastity, can also come under norms of particular law.\nIt is reserved to the Apostolic See to approve new forms of consecrated life. Patriarchs and eparchial bishops shall strive to discover new gifts of consecrated life as entrusted to the Church by the Holy Spirit, and they shall support their promoters in order that they may better manifest their purpose, and shall protect them by appropriate statutes.\nSocieties of apostolic life, whose members without religious vows pursue the particular apostolic purpose of the society, and leading a life as brothers in common according to their own rule of life, striving for the perfection of charity through the observance of their constitutions, and which are comparable to institutes of the consecrated life are governed only by the particular law of their own Church sui iuris or established by the Apostolic See.\nTITLE XIII.\nASSOCIATIONS OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITHFUL\n\u00a7 1. Associations which are erected by competent ecclesiastical authority, or approved by the decree of the same authority, are juridical persons in the Church and are called public associations.\n\u00a7 2. Other associations, even if praised or recommended by ecclesiastical authority, are called private associations; these associations are not recognized in the Church, unless their statutes are reviewed by competent authority; for the rest, they are regulated only by particular law with due regard for can. 577.\nWith due regard in any case for can. 18, the competent ecclesiastical authority alone has the right to erect associations of Christian faithful which set out to teach Christian doctrine in the name of the Church or to promote public worship or which aim at other ends whose pursuit by their nature is reserved to the same ecclesiastical authority.\n\u00a7 1. The competent authority for erecting or approving associations of Christian faithful, for associations and their confederations:\n1\u00b0 the eparchial bishop for eparchial associations, but not the administrator of the eparchy, excepting those associations whose erection has been reserved to others by apostolic or patriarchal privilege;\n2\u00b0 the patriarch after consultation with his permanent synod, or the metropolitan after consultation with the two eparchial bishops senior in Episcopal ordination, for associations open to all Christian faithful of any patriarchal or metropolitan Church sui iuris and which has its principal see within the territorial boundaries of the same Church;\n3\u00b0 the Apostolic See for other types.\n\u00a7 2. For the erection of any branch of any non-eparchial association, the written consent of the eparchial bishop is required; however, the consent given by an eparchial bishop for the erection of a house of a religious institute also allows for the erection in the same house or church attached to it, of an association proper to the institute.\n\u00a7 1. Every association is to have its own statutes, in which are defined its name, purpose, headquarters, government and the conditions required for membership. Besides these things, the statutes are to determine its policies in accordance with the rite of their own Church sui iuris and the needs or usefulness of the place and time.\n\u00a7 2. The statutes and their modification require the approval of the ecclesiastical authority which erected or approved the association.\n\u00a7 1. Every association is subject to the vigilance of the ecclesiastical authority which erected or approved it; this authority is to see that the integrity of faith and morals is preserved in them, and to watch lest abuse should creep into ecclesiastical discipline.\n\u00a7 2. It is the duty of the eparchial bishop to be vigilant of all associations exercising activity in his territory, and as the case may be, to notify the authority which has erected or approved them, and further, if the action of the association causes serious harm to ecclesiastical doctrine or discipline, or is a scandal to Christian faithful, to apply appropriate remedies in the meantime.\n\u00a7 1. The reception of members is to be done in accordance with the norm of common law and the statutes of the association.\n\u00a7 2. The same person can be ascribed to several associations.\n\u00a7 3. Members of religious institutes can give their name in associations, according to the norm of typicon or statutes with the consent of their superior.\nNo association of Christian faithful can ascribe its members as clerics without a special concession of the Apostolic See, or, if it is an association covered by can. 575, \u00a7 1, n. 2, by the patriarch, with the consent of the permanent synod.\nOne who has publicly rejected the Catholic faith, or has publicly abandoned communion with the Catholic Church, or has been punished with major excommunication, cannot validly be received into associations; but if he has already been lawfully ascribed, he should be declared dismissed by the local hierarch ipso iure.\nNo one who has been lawfully ascribed to an association may be dismissed from it except for a just reason in accordance with the norms of common law and of the statutes.\nA lawfully erected or approved association administers temporal goods according to the norms of the cann. 1007 \u2013 1054 and according to the norm of its own statutes, under the vigilance of the authority which erected or approved it, to whom the association must render an account of its administration each year.\n\u00a7 1. Associations erected or approved by the Apostolic See can be only suppressed by the Apostolic See.\n\u00a7 2. The other associations can be suppressed not only by the Apostolic See but, without prejudice to can. 927, \u00a7 2 and with due regard for the right of recourse with suspensive effect according to the norm of law:\n1\u00b0 by the patriarch with the consent of the permanent synod; or by the metropolitan who presides in a metropolitan Church sui iuris, with the consent of the two senior eparchial bishops according to episcopal ordination;\n2\u00b0 by an eparchial bishop, if the associations were erected or approved by him.\nTITLE XIV.\n\u00a7 1. The Church, following the mandate of Christ to evangelize all peoples, and moved by the grace and charity of the Holy Spirit, recognizes herself to be totally missionary.\n\u00a7 2. The evangelization of the peoples should be so done that, preserving the integrity of faith and morals, the Gospel can be expressed in the culture of individual peoples; namely, in catechetics, their own liturgical rites, in sacred art, in particular law, and, in short, the whole ecclesial life.\n\u00a7 1. Each of the Churches sui iuris is to continually see that, through suitably prepared preachers sent by the competent authority according to the norms of the common law, the Gospel is preached in the whole world under the guidance of the Roman Pontiff.\n\u00a7 2. The synod of bishops of the patriarchal Church or the council of hierarchs is to establish a commission to foster a more effective co-operation among all the eparchies in the missionary activity of the Church.\n\u00a7 3. In the individual eparchies a priest is to be designated to effectively promote endeavours on behalf of the missions.\n\u00a7 4. Christian faithful are to promote among themselves and others knowledge and love for the missions, to pray for them, to inspire vocations and support them generously with their own means.\nIt is strictly forbidden to compel, to coax through wily tricks or to allure anyone to join the Church. All the Christian faithful are to be concerned that the right to religious freedom is vindicated, so that no one is frightened off the Church by unjust harassment.\n\u00a7 1. Persons who desire to join the Church are to be admitted with liturgical ceremonies to the catechumenate, which is not a mere presentation of teachings and precepts, but a formation in all the Christian life.\n\u00a7 2. Persons who are ascribed to the catechumenate have the right to be admitted to the liturgy of the word and other liturgical celebrations not reserved to Christian faithful.\n\u00a7 3. It is for the particular law to enact norms to regulate the catechumenate, determining what is to be done by the catechumens and what prerogatives are recognized as theirs.\nCatechumens are at liberty to be ascribed in whatever Church sui iuris they want, according to the norm of can. 30; however, precaution is to be taken against their being given any advice that prevents their ascription in the Church that is more appropriate to their culture.\nMissionaries either native or non-native are to be equipped with the necessary skills and ability; they are to be suitably trained in missiology and missionary spirituality, as well as instructed in the history and culture of the peoples to be evangelized.\nIn missionary activity attention must be paid that the young Churches reach maturity as soon as possible and be fully constituted so that, under the guidance of their own hierarchy, they can provide for themselves, and undertake and carry on the work of evangelization.\nMissionaries are to be diligent in ensuring that:\n1\u00b0 vocations to the sacred ministries are prudently promoted among the neophytes so that the young Churches flourish at the earliest with native clergy;\n2\u00b0 the formation of catechists is such that, as valid co-operators of the sacred ministers, they can fittingly discharge their task in the work of evangelization and in liturgical service. In particular law provision is to be made for the just remuneration of the catechists.\n\u00a7 1. In mission territories suitable forms of lay apostolate are to be fostered with special care; institutes of consecrated life are to be promoted taking into account the particular genius and character of the different peoples; schools and other such institutions of Christian education and cultural progress are to be established, as needed.\n\u00a7 2. Moreover, dialogue and co-operation with non-Christians are to be fostered earnestly and prudently.\n\u00a7 1. As all the presbyters of whatever condition working in a mission territory form one presbyterate, they are to co-operate zealously in the work of evangelization.\n\u00a7 2. They are to co-operate readily, in accordance with can. 908, with all other Christian missionaries, so that they can render united witness to Christ the Lord.\nMission territories are those recognized as such by the Apostolic See.\nTITLE XV.\nTHE ECCLESIASTICAI MAGISTERIUM\nTHE TEACHING FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH IN GENERAL\n\u00a7 1. Christ the Lord has entrusted to the Church the deposit of faith so that, by the assistance of the Holy Spirit, it may conscientiously guard revealed truth, profoundly investigate it and faithfully proclaim and expound it; the Church has hence the innate right, independent of any human power, and the duty to preach the gospel to all people.\n\u00a7 2. The Church has the right always and everywhere to proclaim moral principles, including those pertaining to the social order, and to make judgements about any human affair in so far as this is required by the dignity and the fundamental rights of the human person or the salvation of souls.\nThe office of teaching in the name of the Church belongs only to bishops; but that function is shared, according to the norm of law, both by those who have been made collaborators of the bishops by sacred orders and by those who, though not in sacred orders, have received the mandate to teach.\n\u00a7 1. The Roman Pontiff, in virtue of his office (munus), possesses infallible teaching authority who, as supreme pastor and teacher of all Christian faithful , has the duty to confirm his fellow believers in the faith,, he proclaims with a definitive act that a doctrine of faith or morals is to be held.\n\u00a7 2. The college of bishops also possesses infallible teaching authority if the bishops, gathered in an ecumenical council, exercise their teaching authority, and, as teachers and judges of faith and morals for the universal Church, declare that a doctrine of faith or morals must be definitively held; they also exercise it scattered throughout the world but united in a bond of communion among themselves and with the successor of Peter when together with that same Roman Pontiff in their capacity as authentic teachers of faith and morals they agree on an opinion to be held as definitive.\n\u00a7 3. No doctrine is understood to be infallibly defined unless it is clearly established as such.\nThose things are to be believed by divine and catholic faith which are contained in the word of God as it has been written or handed down by tradition, that is, in the single deposit of faith entrusted to the Church, and which are at the same time proposed as divinely revealed either by the solemn magisterium of the Church, or by its ordinary and universal magisterium, which in fact is manifested by the common adherence of Christ\\\u2019s faithful under the guidance of the sacred magisterium. All are therefore bound to shun any contrary doctrines.\nA religious obsequium of intellect and will, even if not the assent of faith, is to be paid to the teaching on faith and morals which the Roman Pontiff or the college of bishops enunciate when they exercise the authentic magisterium even if they do not intend to proclaim it with a definitive act; therefore Christian faithful are to take care to avoid whatever is not in harmony with that teaching.\nWhether they teach individually, or gathered together in synods or in particular councils, bishops in communion with the head and members of the College, while not infallible in their teaching, are the authentic instructors and teachers of the faith for the faithful entrusted to their care. The faithful are bound to adhere with religious obsequium of mind to the authentic magisterium of their bishops.\nEach Church has the task, which is to be accomplished in the first place by the patriarchs and the bishops in a manner adapted to each age and culture, of answering the perennial questions concerning the meaning of life and having examined the signs of the times in the light of the gospel, providing Christian solutions to the more pressing problems, so that the light of Christ might shine everywhere more brightly illuminating all people.\nIn pastoral care besides the principles of sacred sciences the contributions of other sciences also are to be recognized and utilized, so that Christian faithful may be led to a more conscious and reflective life of faith.\nLiterature and arts, given their unique power to express and communicate the sense of faith, are to be promoted recognizing due freedom and cultural diversity.\nIt is above all for the pastors of the Church to be diligent in ensuring that amidst the varieties of doctrinal enunciations in the various Churches the same sense of faith is preserved and promoted, so that the integrity and unity of faith suffer no harm, rather that the catholicity of the Church is brought into better focus through legitimate diversity.\nIt pertains to bishops, especially as they are gathered in synods or councils, but in a unique way to the Apostolic See, to promote authoritatively, to guard and conscientiously to defend the integrity and unity of faith and good morals, even reprobating, according to need, opinions that are contrary to them or warning about those things that can endanger them.\n\u00a7 1. It is for theologians, given their profound understanding of the mystery of salvation and their expertise in the sacred and related sciences as well as in current problems, to elucidate the faith of the Church, to defend it and to pave the way for doctrinal progress, while faithfully submitting to the authentic magisterium of the Church and at the same time availing themselves of proper freedom.\n\u00a7 2. In the research and expression of theological truths, it is for them to be solicitous about the community of faith that is to be built up, and as resource persons to co-operate diligently with the bishops in the discharge of their teaching office.\n\u00a7 3. Those engaged in theological subjects in seminaries, universities and faculties are to seek to co-operate with those well versed in other fields of learning by the sharing of views and resources.\nTHE MINISTRY OF THE WORD OF GOD\nThe ministry of the word of God, namely preaching, catechesis and all forms of Christian instruction, among which the liturgical homily should hold pride of place, is to be wholesomely nourished by sacred Scripture and is to be based on sacred tradition. The celebration of the word of God is to be seasonably fostered.\nIt is bishops, priests and deacons \u2013 each one according to the grade of his sacred order \u2013 who exercise in the first place the ministry of the word of God. This ministry is to be exercised according to the norm of law. Other Christian faithful, too, are to take part in it readily, according to each one\\\u2019s aptitude and state of life, and after having received a mandate.\nART. I.\nTHE PREACHING OF THE WORD OF GOD\nThe eparchial bishop is competent to regulate the preaching of the word of God in his territory, without prejudice to common law.\n\u00a7 1. Bishops have the right to preach the word of God everywhere, unless the eparchial bishop in a special case expressly forbids it.\n\u00a7 2. Priests have the faculty to preach where they are legitimately sent or invited.\n\u00a7 3. Deacons too have the same faculty, unless particular law has determined otherwise.\n\u00a7 4. In extraordinary circumstances, especially to supply for the scarcity of clerics, the eparchial bishop also may give the mandate to preach even in church to other Christian faithful, observing can. 614, \u00a7 4.\nBy virtue of their office, all who have been entrusted with the care of souls have the faculty to preach, they can also invite any priest or without prejudice to can. 610, \u00a7 3, any deacon to preach to those committed to their care, unless these are legitimately prohibited.\n\u00a7 1. In religious institutes or societies of common life in the manner of clerical religious of pontifical or patriarchal law, the major superiors are the moderators of preaching.\n\u00a7 2. All superiors, even local ones, of whatever institute of consecrated life, can invite to preach to their own subjects any priest or, without prejudice to can. 610, \u00a7 3, any deacon, unless these are legitimately prohibited.\nAgainst the decree of a hierarch forbidding someone to preach, there is recourse in devolutivo only, which must be resolved without delay.\n\u00a7 1. The homily, in which during the course of the liturgical year the mysteries of faith and the norms of Christian living are expounded from Sacred Scripture, is strongly recommended as part of the liturgy itself.\n\u00a7 2. Parish priests and rectors of churches have the obligation to take care that a homily is preached at least during the Divine Liturgy on Sundays and holy days of obligation. It is not to be omitted except for a grave reason.\n\u00a7 3. Parish priests are not allowed to have habitually a substitute to discharge their duty to preach to the people committed to their pastoral care except for a just reason approved by the local hierarch.\n\u00a7 4. The homily is reserved to a priest or, according to norm of particular law, also to a deacon.\nEparchial bishops are to issue norms so that special series of sacred preaching are held at suitable times for the spiritual renewal of the Christian people.\n\u00a7 1. The preachers of the word of God should set aside words of human wisdom and abstruse themes and preach to Christian faithful the entire mystery of Christ, who is the way, the truth and the life; let them show that earthly things and human institutions are also ordered, according to the plan of God the Creator, to the salvation of humanity, and that they can therefore make no small contribution to the building up of the Body of Christ.\n\u00a7 2. Let them teach also the doctrine of the Church about the dignity of the human person and fundamental human rights, about family life, social and civil life, the sense of justice to be pursued in the world of work and of economics, a sense which can make for the building of peace on earth and bring about the progress of peoples.\nART. II,\nCATECHETICAL FORMATION\nEach Church sui iuris and particularly their bishops have the serious duty of providing catechesis, by which faith matures and the disciple of Christ is formed through a deeper and more systematic knowledge of the teaching of Christ and through an increasingly stronger commitment to the person of Christ.\nBefore all others it is parents who are in duty bound to form their children, by word and example, in faith and Christian living. Those who take the place of parents and sponsors are bound by an equal obligation.\nBesides the Christian family, the parish itself and every ecclesial community have to ensure the catechetical formation of their members and their integration in the same community, by assuring those conditions in which what they learn can be lived to the full.\nAssociations, movements and groups of Christ\\\u2019s faithful having for their goal piety, apostolate or charitable works and assistance are to ensure the religious formation of their members under the guidance of the local hierarch.\n\u00a7 1. The synod of bishops of the patriarchal Church or the council of hierarchs is competent to enact norms on catechetical formation within the territorial boundaries of their own Church, observing what has been prescribed by the supreme authority of the Church. The said norms are to be aptly arranged in a catechetical directory.\n\u00a7 2. In this catechetical directory the special character of the Eastern Churches is to be taken into account, so that the biblical and liturgical dimensions as well as the traditions of the respective Church sui iuris in patrology, hagiography, and even iconography are highlighted in the imparting of catechesis.\n\u00a7 3. Synods of bishops of the patriarchal Church or councils of hierarchs are to see to it that catechisms adapted to the various groups of Christ\\\u2019s faithful are prepared along with aids and resources, and that the different catechetical initiatives are promoted and are co-ordinated among themselves.\n\u00a7 1. In each Church sui iuris there is to be a catechetical commission, which may be established together with the other Churches sui iuris for the same territory or socio-cultural region.\n\u00a7 2. This commission is to avail itself of a catechetical centre, which is to be of service to the same Churches in accomplishing their catechetical tasks in a co-ordinated and of more efficacious way and to assure the formation, including the ongoing formation, of catechists.\n\u00a7 1. It is for the eparchial bishops to promote, direct, and regulate the catechetical formation in his eparchy with the utmost solicitude.\n\u00a7 2. For this purpose the services of an eparchial catechetical centre are to be available to the eparchial curia.\nThe parish priest should, keeping to the norms determined by competent authority, make the utmost effort to give catechesis to all persons entrusted to his pastoral care, whatever their age or condition.\n\u00a7 2. Presbyters and deacons attached to the parish are bound to render their assistance to the parish priests; members of religious institutes, however, are to assist in accordance with cann. 479 and 542.\n\u00a7 3. Other Christian faithful, properly formed, are to be ready to offer their help in giving catechesis.\nCatechesis should be ecumenical in orientation and present the correct image of the other Churches and ecclesial communities. Care is to be taken that the right spirit of Catholic catechesis is safeguarded at all costs.\nLet all who are engaged in catechesis remember that they represent the Church, and that they have been sent to communicate the revealed word of God, not their own; they are therefore to present the entire doctrine of the Church, albeit adapted to those they are catechizing and responsive to the demands of their culture.\n\u00a7 1. The responsibility for the education of children belongs primarily to their parents or to those who take their place. Therefore it is for them to educate their children, especially in piety toward God and love of neighbour, in the context of a Christian family that is illumined by faith and animated by mutual love.\n\u00a7 2. In so far as it is beyond their own resources to provide for the overall education of their children, it is also up to them to entrust others with a share of their educational task and to choose those means of education that are necessary or useful.\n\u00a7 3. Parents are to enjoy true freedom in the choice of the means of education, without prejudice to can. 633; therefore the Christian faithful are to see that this right is recognized by the civil authority and even fostered by suitable assistance in accordance with the requirements of justice.\n\u00a7 1. The Church, which has generated new creatures through baptism, has the duty to care for their Catholic education together with parents.\n\u00a7 2. All those who are entrusted with the care of souls must help parents in educating their children, make them aware of their rights and obligations and provide for the religious education especially of young people.\nAll educators are to pay heed to the formation of the whole human person in such a way that young people, having developed their physical, intellectual and moral talents harmoniously, and well versed in the Christian virtues, may be disposed to knowing and loving God more perfectly, to evaluating human and moral values with right conscience and accepting them in true freedom, and having developed a sense of justice and social responsibility, to pursuing loving fellowship with others.\n\u00a7 1. Christian faithful are to work generously so that the appropriate benefits of education and instruction can be extended to all people everywhere, with special concern for the less fortune.\n\u00a7 2. All Christian faithful should support the initiatives of the Church in promoting education, especially in erecting, conducting and maintaining schools.\nSCHOOLS, ESPECIALLY CATHOLIC SCHOOLS\n\u00a7 1. Among the various means of education the Catholic school is to be fostered with special care, and it should be the focus of the concern of the parents, of the teachers, and of the ecclesial community.\n\u00a7 2. It is the right of the Church to establish and supervise schools of any type or level.\nA school is not considered Catholic in law unless it was established as such by the eparchial bishop or by a superior ecclesiastical authority or has been recognized as such by them.\n\u00a7 1. The eparchial bishop has the right to judge any school whatever and to decide whether it fulfils the requirements of Christian education or not; he has also the right to forbid the Christian faithful, for a grave reason, to attend a particular school.\n\u00a7 2. Parents should send their children to Catholic schools, other things being equal.\n\u00a7 1. The Catholic school has a particular obligation to create an atmosphere animated by the gospel spirit of freedom and love in the school community, to help the young in the development of their own personality in such a way that at one and the same time they grow in accordance with that new creature in to which they have been transformed through baptism, and it should so orient the whole of human culture to the message of salvation that the knowledge which the students gradually acquire of the world, of life and of mankind is illumined by faith.\n\u00a7 2. It is up to the Catholic school to adapt these things to the particular circumstances under the supervision of the competent ecclesiastical authority, if for the most part its pupils are non-Catholics.\n\u00a7 3. It is up to the Catholic school to pursue, no less than other schools, cultural goals as well as the human and social formation of the young people.\nThe eparchial bishop is to see to it that Catholic schools are established especially in those places where other schools are lacking or are inadequate; so too professional and technical schools as required especially by particular circumstances of place and time.\n\u00a7 1. Catechetical formation in any school whatever is subject to the authority and vigilance of the eparchial bishop.\n\u00a7 2. It is also the responsibility of the eparchial bishop to nominate or approve the teachers of Catholic religion as well as to remove them or demand their removal, if necessary for reasons of faith or morals.\nIn those schools in which Catholic instruction is lacking or, in the judgement of the eparchial bishop, is deficient, true Catholic formation must be supplied for all the Catholic students.\n\u00a7 1. The eparchial bishop has the right of visiting all the Catholic schools in his eparchy, excepting those schools meant exclusively for the students of institutes of consecrated life that are of pontifical or patriarchal law, and in case without prejudice to the autonomy of those institutes of consecrated life as regards the management of their schools.\n\u00a7 2. Where there are several eparchial bishops, the right of canonical visitation belongs to the one who founded or approved the school, unless it is stipulated otherwise in the stautes of foundation or in a special agreement made by the same bishops.\nAs it depends chiefly on the teachers a Catholic school achieves its purpose and realizes its undertakings, they be outstanding in doctrine and exemplary in the witness of their lives; and they are to work in close collaboration chiefly with the parents but also with other schools.\nART. II.\nCATHOLIC UNIVERSITIES\n\u00a71. The Catholic university aims at making the Christian viewpoint bring to bear on the programme to promote the whole range of higher culture in a public, stable and universal manner; therefore it provides higher education in research, reflection and teaching, in which the various areas of human knowledge are illumined by the light of the gospel.\n\u00a7 2. Other institutes of higher education or autonomous Catholic faculties having the same object are equivalent to Catholic universities, however, ecclesiastical universities and faculties dealt with in cann. 646 \u2013 650, are not.\nIn Catholic universities each field of study is to be cultivated according to its own principles, its own method and the freedom of scientific inquiry that is proper to it, so that as time goes on a deeper understanding of these disciplines may be obtained, and by paying careful attention to contemporary problems and research the convergence of faith and reason in the one truth may be seen more clearly, and that persons outstanding in doctrine may be formed who are ready to fill the more responsible posts in society and to bear witness to their faith in the world.\n\u00a7 1. A Catholic university is an institute of higher studies which is erected as such or is approved either by the higher administrative authority of a Church sui iuris after previous consultation of the Apostolic See or by the Apostolic See itself; such erection or approval must be by public document.\n\u00a7 2. Within the territorial boundaries of a patriarchal Church this higher authority is the patriarch with the consent of the synod of bishops of the patriarchal Church.\nIn Catholic universities in which there is no faculty of theology, at least courses are to be given in theology adapted to the students of the various faculties.\nThose who teach subjects regarding faith and morals in Catholic universities must possess a mandate of the ecclesiastical authority designated by those mentioned in can. 642; the same authority can take away this mandate for a serious reason especially if the teachers lack scientific or pedagogical suitability, probity, or integrity of doctrine.\nIt is the responsibility of hierarchs to provide, after due consultation, in hostels and Catholic university centers, also in other universities; carefully chosen and prepared Christian faithful should offer spiritual and intelletual help to young university students on a permanent basis.\nART. III.\nECCLESIASTICAL UNIVERSITIES AND FACULTIES\nHierarchs above all are to promote ecclesiastical universities and faculties, that is, those which deal chiefly with Christian revelation and sciences connected with it and so are closely linked with the Church\\\u2019s task of evangelization.\nThe aim of ecclesiastical universities and faculties is:\n1\u00b0 to inquire more deeply and scientifically into divine revelation and all that is related to it, to analyse and to structure systematically the truths of divine revelation, to study contemporary problems in its light, and to present these matters to the people of today in a way that is suited to their culture.\n2\u00b0 to give higher education to students of various disciplines according to Catholic doctrine and to prepare them properly for various apostolates or ministries or for teaching the same disciplines, and to promote ongoing formation.\nEcclesiastical universities and faculties are those that have been canonically erected or approved by competent ecclesiastical authority, cultivate and teach the sacred sciences and related subjects, and have the right to confer academic degrees with canonical effects.\nThe erection or approbation of ecclesiastical universities or faculties is done either by the Apostolic See or by the superior administrative authority, dealt with in can. 642, together with the Apostolic See.\nRegarding the statutes of the ecclesiastical universities and faculties, especially as regards the governance, administration, appointment of teachers and the cessation of their office, programme of studies, and conferral of academic degrees, the norms given by the Apostolic See are to be followed.\nINSTRUMENTS OF SOCIAL COMMUNICATION AND SPECIFICALLY BOOKS\n\u00a7 1. In order to fulfill its task of announcing the gospel throughout the world the Church has to make use of suitable means. Therefore the right to the use of the means of social communication and in particular to the freedom of the press ought to be vindicated everywhere.\n\u00a7 2. All Christ\\\u2019s faithful for their part are to collaborate in this great mission of the Church, and support and foster the initiatives of this apostolate. Moreover, let those especially who are experts in the production and the transmission of communications offer their caring help to the pastoral action of the bishops, and earnestly endeavour to bring about the use of the media imbued with the spirit of Christ.\n\u00a7 1. Eparchial bishops are to see that with the help of institutes of social communication the Christian faithful are taught to use the media critically and advantageously; they are to foster co-operation among such institutes, see to the formation of experts, and finally promote good initiatives, praising and blessing in the first place good books, a policy that is more efficacious than the censure and condemnation of evil.\n\u00a7 2. For the safeguarding of the integrity of faith and morals, the eparchial bishop, the synod of bishops of the patriarchal Church, the council of hierarchs, and the Apostolic See are competent to forbid the Christian faithful to use or to pass on to others means of social communication, to the extent that these are detrimental to that same integrity.\nIt is for the particular law to lay down more detailed norms about the use of radio, cinema, television and the like dealing with Catholic doctrine or morals.\nThe norms of common law on books apply also to any other writings whatever or messages reproduced by any technical means and intended for public distribution.\n\u00a7 1. The Christian faithful ought to have easy access to Sacred Scriptures. Therefore suitable and correct translations, furnished with sufficient explanations, are to be prepared, where they are lacking, under the care of the eparchial bishops, even in collaboration with other Christians, as far as this can be done properly and usefully.\n\u00a7 2. Let all the Christian faithful, especially the pastors of souls, be concerned to spread copies of the bible, furnished with apt notes suited also for the use of non-Christians.\n\u00a7 3. For liturgical and catechetical purposes only those editions of the sacred scripture which have ecclesiastical approval may be used; other editions must have at least ecclesiastical permission.\n\u00a7 1. Only those books which have ecclesiastical approval may be used in liturgical celebrations.\n\u00a7 2. Books of prayer or devotions, intended for either the public or the private use of the Christian faithful, are to have ecclesiastical permission.\n\u00a7 1. The approval of liturgical texts, after prior review of the Apostolic See, is reserved in patriarchal Churches to the patriarch with the consent of the synod of bishops of the patriarchal Church, in metropolitan Churches sui iuris to the metropolitan with the consent of the council of hierarchs; in other Churches this right rests exclusively with the Apostolic See, and, within the limits set by it, to bishops and to their lawfully constituted assemblies.\n\u00a7 2. The same authorities are also competent to approve the translations of these books meant for liturgical use, after sending a report to the Apostolic see in the case of patriarchal Churches and metropolitan Churches sui iuris.\n\u00a7 3. To reprint liturgical books or their translations into another language or even parts thereof, if intended for liturgical use, it is required and suffices to establish their correspondence with the approved edition by an attestation of the local hierarch referred to in can. 662, \u00a71.\n\u00a7 4. In making changes in liturgical texts, attention is to be paid to can. 40, \u00a7 1.\n\u00a7 1. Catechisms and other writings intended for catechetical instruction in schools of whatever kind and grade, and their translations, need ecclesiastical approval.\n\u00a7 2. The same norm is to be applied also to other books dealing with faith and morals, if they are used as textbooks for catechetical instruction.\nIt is recommended that all writings whatever which explain the faith or morals of the Church have at least ecclesiastical permission, without prejudice to the prescriptions of institutes of consecrated life, which require more.\nUnless there is a just and reasonable cause, no member of the Christian faithful may write in newspapers, magazines or periodicals which are accustomed to attack openly the Catholic religion or good morals; clerics and members of religious institutes moreover need the permission of those spoken of in can. 662.\n\u00a7 1. Ecclesiastical permission, expressed only with the word imprimatur, means that the work is free from errors regarding Catholic faith and morals.\n\u00a7 2. Approval granted by competent authority shows that the text is accepted by the Church or that the work is in accordance with the authentic doctrine of the Church.\n\u00a7 3. A work that is in addition praised or blessed by the eparchial bishop or superior authority means that it expresses well the authentic doctrine of the Church and therefore is to be recommended.\n\u00a7 1. Ecclesiastical approval or permission to publish books may be granted, unless expressly stated otherwise in the law, either by the author\\\u2019s own local hierarch or by the hierarch of the place of publication, or finally by a superior authority having executive power over these persons or places.\n\u00a7 2. In order to publish writings dealing with religious and moral topics, members of religious institutes need also the permission of their major superior, according to the norm of their typicon or statutes.\n\u00a7 1. Permission to publish a work or its approval, praise, or blessing is valid only for the original text, but not for new editions or translations.\n\u00a7 2. In case of editions of the Sacred Scriptures or other books requiring ecclesiastical approval by law, the approval llawfully granted by one hierarch of the place is not enough for its use in another eparchy, but the explicit consent of the hierarch of that eparchy is required.\n\u00a7 1. The local hierarch may abide by the judgement about books given by censors selected from the list drawn up by the synod of bishops of the patriarchal Church, or the council of hierarchs, or he may rely on others, according to this discretion; also a special commission of censors may be set up for the local hierarch, the synod of bishops of the patriarchal Church, or the council of hierarchs to consult.\n\u00a7 2. The censors selected are to be outstanding for their knowledge, right doctrine and prudence; in carrying out their office they are to give their judgement without any partiality but in accordance with Catholic doctrine as proposed by the Church\\\u2019s authentic magisterium.\n\u00a7 3. The censors must give their opinion in writing; if it is favourable, the hierarch may grant permission or approval, according to his discretion, expressly in his own name; otherwise he must inform the author of the reasons for the refusal.\n\u00a7 1. Parish priests and rectors of churches are to be watchful that in their churches are not displayed, sold or distributed either icons or images that are not in keeping with genuine sacred art or books that are not in harmony with the Christian religion or morals.\n\u00a7 2. So also parish priests and rectors of churches and directors of Catholic schools have to take care that shows of whatever type conducted under their sponsorship are selected with the sense of Christian discretion.\n\u00a7 3. Let all the Christian faithful be careful not to bring spiritual harm upon themselves or others by buying, selling, reading, or passing on to others those things mentioned in \u00a7 1.\n\u00a7 1. The fruit of an author\\\u2019s intellectual efforts is under the protection of the law whether as the expression of the author\\\u2019s personality or as the source of patrimonial rights.\n\u00a7 2. Under the protection of law are the texts of laws and the official acts of whatever ecclesiastical authority and of their authentic collections; and therefore they may not be republished without obtaining the permission of the same or superior authority, and observing the conditions laid down by it.\n\u00a7 3. More detailed norms about this matter may be issued in the particular law of each Church sui iuris, in accordance with the civil laws concerning the rights of authors\nTITLE XVI.\nDIVINE ,WORSHIP AND ESPECIALLY THE SACRAMENTS\nThrough the sacraments, which the Church is bound to dispense to communicate the mysteries of Christ under visible signs, our Lord Jesus Christ sanctifies people by the power of the Holy Spirit, so that they become in a unique way true worshipers of God the Father and are inserted into Christ and the Church, His Body; therefore all Christ\\\u2019s faithful, especially sacred ministers, are to observe diligently the prescriptions of the Church in the conscientious celebration and reception of the sacraments.\n\u00a7 1. Divine worship, if it is done in the name of the Church by a person lawfully appointed for this and through an act approved by the authority of the Church, is called public; if not, it is called private.\n\u00a7 2. For the regulation of divine public worship the competent authority is the one mentioned in can. 657, with due regard for can. 199, \u00a7 1; no other person can add to, remove, or modify that which was established by this authority.\nSince the sacraments are the same for the entire Church and belong to the divine deposit, it is for the supreme authority of the Church alone to approve or define those things which are required for their validity.\n\u00a7 1. For a just cause Catholics can attend the liturgical worship of other Christians and take part in the same, observing those things which, by reason of the degree of communion with the Catholic Church, are established by the eparchial bishop or by a superior authority.\n\u00a7 2. If non-Catholic Christians lack a place in which divbilises: th dignity, the eparchial bishop can grant the use of a Catholic building or cemetery or church according to the norm of particular law of his own Church sui iuris.\n\u00a7 1. Catholic ministers licitly administer the sacraments only to Catholic Christian faithful, who, likewise, licitly receive the sacraments only from Catholic ministers.\n\u00a7 2. If necessity requires it or genuine spiritual advantage suggests it and provided that the danger of error or indifferentism is avoided, it is permitted for Catholic Christian faithful, for whom it is physically or morally impossible to approach a Catholic minister, to receive the sacraments of penance, the Eucharist and anointing of the sick from non-Catholic ministers, in whose Churches these sacraments are valid.\n\u00a7 3. Likewise Catholic ministers licitly administer the sacraments of penance, the Eucharist and anointing of the sick to Christian faithful of Eastern Churches, who do not have full communion with the Catholic Church, if they ask for them on their own and are properly disposed. This holds also for the Christian faithful of other Churches, who according to the judgement of the Apostolic See, are in the same condition as the Eastern Churches as far as the sacraments are concerned.\n\u00a7 4. If there is a danger of death or another matter of serious necessity in the judgement of the eparchial bishop, the synod of bishops of the patriarchal Church or the council of hierarchs, Catholic ministers licitly administer the same sacraments also to other Christians not having full communion with the Catholic Church, who cannot approach the ministers of their own ecclesial communities and who request them on their own, provided they manifest a faith consonant with that of the Catholic Church concerning these sacraments and are rightly disposed.\n\u00a7 5. For the cases in \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3 and 4, norms of particular law are to enacted only after consultation with at least the local competent authority of the non-Catholic Church or ecclesial community concerned.\n\u00a7 1. The sacraments of baptism, chrismation with holy myron and sacred ordination cannot be repeated.\n\u00a7 2. If a prudent doubt exists as to whether they have been truly or validly celebrated, and the doubt remains after a serious investigation, they are to be administered conditionally.\nThe celebration of the sacraments, above all the Divine Liturgy, as an action of the Church, in as much as it is possible, should be done with active participation of the Christian faithful.\n\u00a7 1. In celebrating the sacraments that which is contained in the liturgical books is to be observed accurately.\n\u00a7 2. The minister should celebrate the sacraments according to the liturgical prescriptions of his own Church sui iuris, unless the law establishes otherwise or he himself has obtained a special faculty from the Apostolic See.\n\u00a7 1. In baptism a person through washing with natural water with the invocation of the name of God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, is freed from sin, reborn to new life, puts on Christ and is incorporated in the Church which is His Body.\n\u00a7 2. Only by the actual reception of baptism is a person made capable for the other sacraments.\nIn a case of urgent necessity, baptism can be licitly administered by doing only those things which are necessary for validity.\n\u00a71. Baptism is administered ordinarily by a priest; but, with due regard for particular law, the parish priest of the person to be baptized, or another priest with the permission of the same parish priest or the local hierarch, is competent for its administration, which permission, for a serious reason is lawfully presumed.\n\u00a7 2. In case of necessity, baptism can be administered by a deacon or, in his absence or if he is impeded, by another cleric, a member of an institute of consecrated life, or by any other Christian faithful; even by the mother or father, if another person is not available who knows how to baptize.\n\u00a7 1. In the territory of another it is not licit for anyone to administer without the required permission; this permission cannot be denied by the parish priest of a different Church sui iuris to a priest of a Church sui iuris to which the person to be baptized is to be ascribed.\n\u00a7 2. In places where there are not a few Christian faithful lacking a parish priest of the Church sui iuris to which they are ascribed, the eparchial bishop should designate a priest of that Church, if it is possible, who should administer baptism.\nEvery person not yet baptized and only such a person is capable of receiving baptism.\nAn aborted foetus should be baptized, if it is alive and if it can be done,.\n\u00a7 1. For an infant to be licitly baptized it is required that:\n1\u00b0 there is a realistic hope that the infant will be educated in the Catholic Church, without prejudice to \u00a7 5;\n2\u00b0 the parents, or at least one of them, or the person who lawfully takes their place, consent.\n\u00a7 2. Abandoned infants and foundlings, unless their baptism is certainly established, are to be baptized.\n\u00a7 3. Those who lack the use of reason from infancy are to be baptized as infants.\n\u00a7 4. Infants whether of Catholic or even of non-Catholic parents who are in such a critical situation that it can be prudently foreseen that they will die before they reach the use of reason, are licitly baptized.\n\u00a7 5. Infants of non-Catholic Christians are licitly baptized, if their parents or at least one of them or the person who lawfully takes their place request it, and if it is physically or morally impossible for them to approach their own minister.\n\u00a7 1. For a person who is no longer an infant to be baptized, it is required that he or she manifest a desire to receive baptism and be sufficiently instructed in the truths of the faith and be tested in the Christian life; the adult is to be exhorted to have sorrow for personal sins.\n\u00a7 2. A person who is no longer an infant and who is in danger of death can be baptized, if he or she has an understanding of the principal truths of the faith and in any way manifests the intention of receiving baptism.\nBaptism must be celebrated according to the liturgical prescriptions of the Church sui iuris in which according to the norm of law the person to be baptized is to be ascribed.\n\u00a7 1. According to the most ancient tradition of the Churches he person who is to be baptized should have at least one sponsor.\n\u00a7 2. In fulfilling the function of a sponsor; the sponsor is to assist in the Christian initiation for a person who is no longer an infant; or to present the infant to be baptized and to help the baptized person lead a Christian life in harmony with baptism and to fulfill faithfully the obligations connected with it.\n\u00a7 1. For a person to fulfill validly the role of a sponsor it is necessary that he or she:\n1\u00b0 be initiated with the three sacraments of baptism, chrismation with holy myron and the Eucharist;\n2\u00b0 belong to the catholic Church, with due regard for \u00a7 3;\n3\u00b0 have the intention of carrying out the responsibility of sponsor;\n4\u00b0 be designated by the person to be baptized or the parents or guardians, or, if there are not any, by the minister;\n5\u00b0 not be the father, mother or spouse of the person to be baptized;\n6\u00b0 not be bound by excommunication, even a minor one, suspension, deposition or deprived of the right of acting in the function of a sponsor.\n\u00a7 2. To assume lawfully the role of sponsor, in addition to what is required, the sponsor should be of the age required by particular law and lead a life in harmony with the faith and the role to be undertaken.\n\u00a7 3. For a just cause, it is permitted to admit a Christian faithful of another Eastern non-Catholic Church to the function of a sponsor, but always at the same time with a Catholic sponsor.\n\u00a7 1. Parents are held to the obligation that the infant be baptized as soon as possible according to the legitimate custom.\n\u00a7 2. The parish priest is to see to it that the parents of the infant to be baptized and the future sponsors are instructed about the meaning of this sacrament and the obligations connected with it and that they are suitably prepared for the celebration of the sacrament.\n\u00a7 1. Outside of a case of necessity, baptism is to celebrated in a parish church with due regard for lawfull customs.\n\u00a7 2. Baptism can be administered in private homes according to the prescriptions of particular law or with the permission of the local hierarch.\nThe person who administers the baptism is to see to it that, unless there is a sponsor, there be at least one witness, by whom the celebration of the baptism can be proven.\n\u00a7 1. The parish priest of the place where the baptism is celebrated, must record carefully and without delay in the baptismal register, the names of those baptized, making mention also of the minister, the parents, the sponsors, and also the witnesses, if there are any, the place and date of the baptism. To be indicated are also the place of birth and the Church sui iuris in which the baptized persons are ascribed.\n\u00a7 2. If it is a case of a child born of an unwed mother, the name of the other is to be indicated if her maternity is publicly established or if she requests it on her own in writing or before two witnesses; likewise the name of the father is to indicated if his paternity is proven with some public document or by his own declaration made before the parish priest and two witnesses; in other cases the name of the baptized is to be recorded without any indication of the name of the father or parents.\n\u00a7 3. If it is a case of an adopted child, the names of the adoptive parents are recorded and also, at least if it is done in the civil records of the region, the names of the natural parents, according to the norms of \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 and with due regard for particular law.\nIf the baptism was administered neither by the parish priest nor in his presence, the minister must notify the parish priest of the place.\nFor proof of baptism, if it is not prejudicial to anyone, it suffices to have the declaration of one witness who is unexceptionable or even the declaration of the baptized person founded on sure arguments, especially if the person received baptism when no longer an infant.\nCHRISMATION WITH HOLY MYRON\nThose who have been baptized ought to be chrismated with holy myron, in order that signed with the seal of the Holy Spirit\\\u2019s gift they become more efficient witnesses and co-builders of the Kingdom of Christ.\nHoly myron, which is made from the oil of olives or other plants and from aromatics, is confected only by a bishop, with due regard for particular law which reserves this power to the patriarch.\nAccording to the tradition of the Eastern Churches, chrismation with holy myron is administered by a presbyter either in conjunction with baptism or separately.\n\u00a7 1. Chrismation with holy myron must be administered in conjunction with baptism, except in a case of true necessity, in which case, however, care is to be taken to have it administered as soon as possible.\n\u00a7 2. If the celebration of chrismation with holy myron is not done together with baptism, the minister is obliged to notify the parish priest of the place where the baptism was administered.\n\u00a7 1. All presbyters of the Eastern Churches can validly administer this sacrament either along with baptism or separately to all the Christian faithful of any Church sui iuris including the Latin Church.\n\u00a7 2. The Christian faithful of Eastern Churches validly receive this sacrament also from presbyters of the Latin Church, according to the faculties with which these are endowed.\n\u00a7 3. Any presbyter lawfully administers this sacrament only to the Christian faithful of his own Church sui iuris; when it is a case of Christian faithful of other Churches sui iuris, he lawfully acts if they are his subjects, or those whom he lawfully baptizes in virtue of another title, or those who are in danger of death, and always with due regard for the agreements entered between the Churches sui iuris in this matter.\nThe sacramental initiation in the mystery of salvation is completed with the reception of the Divine Eucharist; therefore after baptism and chrismation with holy myron the Divine Eucharist is to be administered as soon as possible according to the norms of the particular law of each Church sui iuris.\nDIVINE EUCHARIST\nWhat the Lord Jesus himself did at the Last Supper is perpetuated in the Divine Liturgy by the power of the Holy Spirit through the ministry of the priest who acts in the person of Christ over the offering of the Church. Christ Jesus gave to his disciples his body, which was to be offered for us on the cross, and his blood, which was to be poured out for us, thus instituting the true and mystical sacrifice. In this sacrifice the bloody sacrifice of the cross is commemorated with thanksgiving, is actuated and shared by the Church through oblation and through communion, in order to signify and realize the unity of the people of God and to build up Christ\\\u2019s Body, namely the Church.\n\u00a7 1. Only bishops and presbyters have the power to celebrate the Divine Liturgy.\n\u00a7 2. Along with bishops and presbyters deacons have a very close share in the celebration of the Divine Liturgy and have a ministry proper to them according to the prescriptions of the liturgical books.\n\u00a7 3. By virtue of their baptism and chrismation with holy myron the other Christian faithful take part in the celebration of the Divine Liturgy and participate actively in the sacrifice of Christ in the manner determined by the liturgical books or particular law; they do so more fully if they receive the body and blood of Christ from the same sacrifice.\n\u00a7 1. With regard to the manner of celebrating the Divine Liturgy, whether it should be done individually or in concelebration, attention should be given above all to the pastoral needs of the Christian faithful.\n\u00a7 2. If it is possible, presbyters are to celebrate the Divine Liturgy together with the presiding bishop or with another presbyter, since thus the unity of the priesthood and of the sacrifice will be properly manifested. Each priest, however, has his inviolate right to celebrate the Divine Liturgy individually, not, however, simultaneously when a concelebration is taking place in the same church.\nBishops and presbyters of different Churches sui iuris may concelebrate for a just reason, especially to foster love and to manifest the unity of the Churches. For this the permission of the eparchial bishop is to be had. All follow the prescriptions of the liturgical books of the principal celebrant, avoiding any liturgical syncretism whatever but all preferably wearing the liturgical vestments and insignia of their own Church sui iuris.\nCatholic priests are forbidden to concelebrate the Divine Liturgy with non-Catholic priests or ministers.\n\u00a7 1. A priest who is a stranger is not to be admitted to the celebration of the Divine Liturgy, unless he shows the rector of the church a letter of recommendation from his own hierarch, or the rector is satisfied in some other way about his honesty.\n\u00a7 2. The eparchial bishop is free to make more specific norms concerning this matter which are to be observed by all priests, even those who are exempt in any way.\nThe Divine Liturgy can be praiseworthily celebrated on any day except those which are excluded according to the prescriptions of the liturgical books of the Church sui iuris in which the priest is ascribed.\n\u00a7 1. A Catholic priest can celebrate the Divine Liturgy on the altar of any Catholic church.\n\u00a7 2. In order for a priest to be able to celebrate the Divine Liturgy in a non-Catholic church, he needs the permission of the local hierarch.\nThe sacred gifts offered in the Divine Liturgy are pure wheat bread recently made, so that there is no danger of corruption, and uncorrupt natural grape wine.\n\u00a7 1. The particular law of each Church sui iuris must have accurate norms determining the preparation of the Eucharistic bread, the prayers to be recited by the priests before the Divine Liturgy, the observance of the Eucharistic fast, the liturgical vestments, the time and place of the celebration and other like matters.\n\u00a7 2. Without causing shock to Christ\\\u2019s faithful, it is lawful to use the liturgical vestments and bread of another Church sui iuris, if the liturgical vestments and bread of one\\\u2019s own Church are not available.\nThe local hierarchs and the parish priests are to ensure that Christ\\\u2019s faithful are very carefully instructed concerning the obligation of receiving the Divine Eucharist in danger of death and also at those times which are established by the laudable tradition or by the particular law of the respective Church sui iuris, especially at Easter time, when Christ the Lord bequeathed the Eucharistic mysteries.\n\u00a7 1. It is the priest who distributes the Divine Eucharist or, if the particular law of his Church sui iuris provides for it, also the deacon.\n\u00a7 2. The synod of bishops of the patriarchal Church or the council of hierarchs is free to establish suitable norms according to which other Christian faithful too, may distribute the Divine Eucharist.\nRegarding the participation of infants in the Divine Eucharist after baptism and chrismation with holy myron, suitable precautions are to be taken and the prescriptions of the liturgical books of the respective Church sui iuris are to be observed.\nWith a grave sin on one\\\u2019s conscience, no one is to celebrate the Divine Liturgy or receive the Divine Eucharist, unless there is a serious reason and there is no opportunity to receive the sacrament of penance.\nIn this case one should make an act of perfect contrition, which comprises the intention of approaching this sacrament as soon as possible.\nThose who are publicly unworthy are to be prevented from receiving the Divine Eucharist.\n\u00a7 1. The Divine Eucharist is to be distributed in the celebration of the Divine Liturgy, unless a just cause suggests otherwise.\n\u00a7 2. Concerning the preparation for participation in the Divine Eucharist through fast, prayers and other works, the Christian faithful are to observe faithfully the norms of the Church sui iuris in which they are ascribed, not only within the territorial boundaries of the same Church, but, in as much as it is possible, everywhere.\n\u00a7 1. Observing faithfully the prescriptions of the liturgical books of the respective Church sui iuris, the Divine Eucharist is to be reserved, especially for the sick, in churches where there is public divine worship and at least several times a month the Divine Liturgy is celebrated. Also, the Divine Eucharist is to be adored with the greatest reverence by Christ\\\u2019s faithful.\n\u00a7 2. The reservation of the Divine Eucharist is under the vigilance and moderation of the local hierarch.\n\u00a7 1. It is lawful for priests to receive the offerings which Christ\\\u2019s faithful, following a custom approved by the Church, give for celebrating the Divine Liturgy for their intentions.\n\u00a7 2. It is also permissible, if it is thus established by lawful custom, to receive offerings for the Liturgy of the Pre sanctified and for commemorations in the Divine Liturgy.\nWithout prejudice to can. 1013, it is earnestly recommended that eparchial bishops introduce, to the extent that this is possible, the practice whereby on the occasion of the Divine Liturgy only those offerings are received which Christ\\\u2019s faithful make on their own accord. Even without any offering individual priests are to celebrate readily the Divine Liturgy for the intentions of Christ\\\u2019s faithful, especially of the needy.\nIf they accept offerings for the Divine Liturgy from the Christian faithful of another Church sui iuris, priests are bound by the grave obligation of observing the norms of that Church, unless it is established otherwise by the donor.\nSACRAMENT OF PENANCE\nIn the sacrament of penance Christian faithful turn to God in their hearts under the leading of the Holy Spirit from the sins committed after baptism. Moved by sorrow for their sins they resolve to lead a new life. Through the ministry of the priest, to whom they make confession and from whom they accept a deserving penance, they obtain forgiveness from God and at the same time are reconciled with the Church, which they have wounded through sin. Thus this sacrament contributes greatly to the fostering of Christian life and disposes Christian faithful for the reception of the Divine Eucharist.\nAnyone who is aware of serious sin is to receive the sacrament of penance as soon as possible; it is strongly recommended to all the Christian faithful that they receive this sacrament frequently especially during the times of fasts and penance observed in their own Church sui iuris.\n\u00a7 1. Individual and integral confession and absolution constitute the sole ordinary means by which Christ\\\u2019s faithful with a grave sin on his or her conscience is reconciled with God and the Church. Physical or moral impossibility alone excuses from such confession, in which case reconciliation can be effected by other means also.\n\u00a7 2. General absolution without prior individual confession cannot be imparted to several penitents together unless:\n1\u00b0 there is imminent danger of death, and there is no time for the priest or priests to administer the sacrament of penance to the individual penitents;\n2\u00b0 there is a grave necessity, that is, if considering the number of penitents, priests are on short supply to administer the sacrament of penance to the individual penitents within a reasonable time so that, through no fault of theirs they will be forced for a long time to forego the sacramental grace or the reception of the Divine Eucharist. The necessity is not regarded as sufficient when it is not possible for confessors to be available merely because of a great gathering of penitents such as can happen on some great feast day or pilgrimage.\n\u00a7 3. The eparchial bishop is competent to decide whether such grave necessity exists. He can, after having held consultation with patriarchs and eparchial bishops of other Churches sui iuris who exercise power in the same territory, determine the cases of such necessity even through general prescriptions.\n\u00a7 1. For Christ\\\u2019s faithful to benefit from a general sacramental absolution given to a number of people, they have not only to be properly disposed but be at the same time personally resolved to confess in due time each of the grave sins which they cannot for the moment so confess.\n\u00a7 2. As far as possible Christ\\\u2019s faithful are to be instructed about these requirements and are besides to be exhorted even in danger of death to make an act of contrition personally.\n\u00a7 1. Only a priest is the minister of the sacrament of penance.\n\u00a7 2. All bishops can ipso iure administer the sacrament of penance throughout the world, unless with regard to liceity, the eparchial bishop opposes it expressly.\n\u00a7 3. For presbyters to act validly, they must besides possess the faculty to administer the sacrament of penance; such faculty is conferred either ipso iure or by a special grant made by competent authority.\n\u00a7 4. Priests who have the faculty to administer the sacrament of penance by virtue of their office or by virtue of a grant of the local hierarch of the eparchy in which they are ascribed or in which they have domicile, can validly administer the sacrament of penance anywhere to any Christian faithful, unless some local hierarch in a special case expressly opposes it. They use these faculties licitly, observing the norms made by the eparchial bishop and also with at least the presumed permission of the rector of the church or, in case of a house of an institute of consecrated life, of the superior.\n\u00a7 1. In virtue of his office and each within the limits of his ambit, besides the local hierarch the parish priest too and any other who takes the place of the parish priest, is endowed with the faculty to administer the sacrament of penance.\n\u00a7 2. In virtue of his office every superior of a religious institute or of a society of common life in the manner of religious of pontifical or patriarchal law, if he is a priest, is endowed with the faculty to administer the sacrament of penance to the members of his own institute and also to those who live in his house day and night.\n\u00a7 1. Only the local hierarch is competent to confer on any presbyterby a special grant the faculty of administering the sacrament of penance to any of the Christian faithful.\n\u00a7 2. The superior of an institute of consecrated life, provided he is endowed with the executive power of governance, can confer the faculty mentioned in can. 723, \u00a7 2 on any presbyter according to the norms of the typicon or statutes.\nAny priest can validly and licitly absolve from any sins any penitents who are in danger of death, even if another priest is present who is endowed with the faculty to administer the sacrament of penance.\n\u00a7 1. The faculty to administer the sacrament of penance may not be revoked except for a serious reason.\n\u00a7 2. If the faculty to administer the sacrament of penance, granted by the hierarch mentioned in can. 722, \u00a7 4 is revoked, the presbyter loses it everywhere; if it is revoked by another competent authority, the presbyter loses it only within the ambit of the one who revokes it.\n\u00a7 3. Apart from revocation, the faculty mentioned in can. 722, \u00a7 4 ceases, by the loss of office, of ascription in an eparchy or of domicile.\nIn some cases, in order to provide for the salvation of souls it may be appropriate to restrict the faculty to absolve from sins and reserve it to a determined authority; this, however, cannot be done without the consent of the Synod of Bishops of the Patriarchal Church or of the Council of Hierarchs or of the Apostolic See.\n\u00a7 1. Absolution from the following sins is reserved to the Apostolic See:\n1\u00b0 direct violation of the sacramental seal;\n2\u00b0 absolution of an accomplice in a sin against chastity.\n\u00a7 2. It is reserved to the eparchial bishop to absolve from the sin of procuring an abortion effectively.\nAny reservation of the absolution from sin lacks all force:\n1\u00b0 if a sick person who cannot leave the house or a spouse confess in order to celebrate marriage;\n2\u00b0 if in the prudent judgement of the confessor, the faculty cannot be requested from the competent authority without grave inconvenience to the penitent or without danger of violation of the sacramental seal;\n3\u00b0 outside the territorial boundaries in which the authority who makes the reservation exercises power.\nAbsolution of an accomplice in a sin against chastity is invalid except in danger of death.\nOne who confesses a false denunciation of an innocent confessor to ecclesiastical authority concerning the crime of solicitation to sin against chastity is not to be absolved unless that person formally retracts the denunciation and is prepared to repair damages if there are any.\n\u00a7 1. The confessor is to offer a fitting cure for the illness by imposing appropriate works of penance in keeping with the quality, seriousness and number of the sins, and considering the condition of the penitent as well as his or her disposition for conversion.\n\u00a7 2. The priest is to remember that he is placed by God as a minister of divine justice and mercy; as a spiritual father he should also offer appropriate counsel so that the penitent might progress in his or her vocation to sanctity.\n\u00a7 1. The sacramental seal is inviolable; therefore the confessor must diligently refrain either by word, sign or any other manner from betraying the penitent for any reason.\n2. The obligation of observing secrecy also binds an interpreter if one is present, and also all others, to whom knowledge of the sins from confession comes in any way.\n\u00a7 1. A confessor is absolutely prohibited to use the knowledge acquired from confession when it might harm the penitent, even if every danger of revelation is excluded.\n\u00a7 2. One who is placed in authority can in no way use for external governance knowledge about sins which he has received in confession at any time.\n\u00a7 3. Directors of institutes of education ordinarily do not administer the sacrament of penance to their students.\n\u00a7 1. All to whom by virtue of an office the care of souls is committed are bound by the grave obligation to provide for the administration of the sacrament of penance to Christ\\\u2019s faithful entrusted to them, who appropriately ask for it; these are also to be given the opportunity to make individual confession on days and at times arranged to suit them.\n\u00a7 2. In urgent necessity any priest endowed with the faculty of administering the sacrament of penance has to administer this sacrament, but in danger of death also any other priest.\n\u00a7 1. The proper place for the celebration of the sacrament of penance is a church, with due regard for particular law.\n\u00a7 2. Because of sickness or another just reason this sacrament can be celebrated also outside its proper place.\nEGYPT ANNOUNCES VATICAN-APPROVED PILGRIM TRAIL OF THE HOLY FAMILY\u2019S JOURNEY FROM SINAI TO ASYUT\n5 \u0623\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0628\u0631, 2017 6 \u0623\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0628\u0631, 2017\nSpeech of the Holy Father to the participants in the International Peace Conference\n\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0627\u062f: \u0644\u0644\u062e\u0627\u062f\u0645 \u0644\u0625\u0642\u0644\u064a\u0645\u064a \u0644\u0644\u0631\u0647\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0646\u0633\u064a\u0633\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0645\u0635\u0631- \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062c\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a\u0629\n26 \u062f\u064a\u0633\u0645\u0628\u0631, 2013 26 \u062f\u064a\u0633\u0645\u0628\u0631, 2013"}
{"text": "I\u2019ve been to parties. Quite a few (haven\u2019t you?). But I\u2019m saved (please, hear me out). I didn\u2019t go to \u201cwild out\u201d or to \u201chave fun.\u201d Truthfully speaking, I went to celebrate whatever event at that time called for a celebration (it\u2019s not an excuse, it just honest). At first, I felt a tad of guilt, but convinced myself that it was harmless because I wasn\u2019t acting crazy. After a while I found myself thinking why I am here? And then I got that feeling that I didn\u2019t belong there. Still I didn\u2019t know if it was necessarily wrong.\nWhen it comes to labeling oneself a Christian, a lot of things are subjective. What\u2019s allowed and what\u2019s not allowed, what\u2019s considered a sin, and what\u2019s not that serious. In the faith of Christianity, the Bible is our blueprint for living. Although it does not necessarily spell out in plain english a list of things, it\u2019s very clear. For example, the bible does not say \u2018Thou shall not smoke\u2019, but it does say that our bodies are temples and we should treat it as such (I Corinthians 6:19-20). But let\u2019s stick to the topic at hand.\nGoing out to the club is a debatable topic for those who called themselves saved indeed, and more so, for the unsaved folks who are silently watching. This article is not to point the finger (because I would have to point it at myself first), nor is it to pass judgment. But it\u2019s written rather, to provoke thought. So in being honest with ourselves, as representatives of Christ, is it okay to get out every now and then to \u201cparty like a rock-star\u201d and \u201cdrop it like it\u2019s hot?\u201d What if it\u2019s my best friend\u2019s (who is unsaved by the way) birthday?!!! (We do have unsaved friends don\u2019t we?) WWJD?\nWhy are you hanging out with unsaved friends. Are you pulling them up or are they puling you down? Please write more obout this topic. There is so much more to say! keep going Marie!\nThis is certainly an intriguing topic. I agree with the above comment more certainly has to be said! But on another note is it really plausible or helpful to associate or develop friendships with only \u201cChristians\u201d?\nI think as a christian we should be allowed to go out and have fun but to a certain limit. We should be leaders not followers, we should be good examples not the other way around.\nChrist in Culture\u2026.we should be able to carry Christ everywhere. There is a need to discern each sitation, a club may not be the best place to be as it exposes us to alot of tempation, however I believe you must be able to discern each situation accordingly.\nWhat type glory does God get by clubbing? Jesus went to many unsavory places, but He drew men to Him\u2026Christians have to be selective there is a real enemy out there seeking to capture our souls.\nYou correctly say as Christians we are guided by de scriptures, and the Holy Spirit who reminds us these truths deep within-perhaps explains the out of place feelings while hanging out, partyin or clubbin-i believe der\u2019s lotsa scripture fi dis- don\u2019t u know bad company ruins good morals, Gal. 5.21, de acts of the flesh are manifest-on the list is revelries which resembles de orgies and happenings in club settings, ppo get prompted to do things they wouldn\u2019t do in broad day light-even de worst of sinners-i think der\u2019s somethin not good wit de atmosphere-it\u2019s conducive for sin-why walk on de edge a de cliff, testin de boundaries is a dangerous thing! i\u2019m of de school of thought that wan should feel free to attend formal corporate parties, dinners that are organised professionally wit clear agendas, the same goes fi friends or family birthdays, even non-believers respect u for being firm about certain things like a no wine policies-they may diss u superficially but appreciate yo boldness deep within, but when the lights turn dim, run, leave! all in all, it simply ain\u2019t about right or wrong, it\u2019s about how much u love de Lord-it\u2019ll make u do right and avoid debates on how close to de edge you\u2019ll walk!\nSometimes we misunderstand the concepts of the Bible and what it means to be a christian. Some people live by what they interpret to be the word of God. Sometimes we try so hard to see things that are right in front of us. We take away credit where it is due and we give too much to where it isn\u2019t deserved. It\u2019s one thing to act like a christian and another to actually be. Like M.Wallace stated, going out to a club or a lounge or even a house party, is very debatable. Who are we to judge one another? In my opinion, as long as you don\u2019t commit the act that is defined as sin, it is okay to have safe fun. Let us remember that we are only as good as our greatest sin. This topic is so broad. I, personally do not like debates. Common sense is something that goes a long way, and sad to say, not a lot of people use it. It\u2019s okay to have fun.\nWe are in this world but not of it. The Holy spirit within us should lead & guide us into all truth.& I agree \u201ccommon sense goes a long way\u201d I use to think everyone had common sense but I\u2019ve come to realize that is not the case. Sometimes folk make Christianity this complex thing & it\u2019s quite the opposite.\nThis is such a wonderful christian online magazine. I am really glad that christians have this opportunity to go online and be encouraged. Keep up the good work!\nFor those of you who are Christians and find it hard to choose whether or not to continue being part of the club scene, there is a new and hot spot called Club Zion in Newark, NJ. It is a Christian Club\u2026.that\u2019s right, a Christian Club. It\u2019s a place where you can dance and glorify God to the hottest Christian music there is. The DJ is excellent, the food is good, and the atmosphere is incredible because the spirit of God is definitely glorified. No smoking, no drinking, no cursing, no grinding, no inappropriate dressing, just pure, clean fun. I went a week ago and I had a blast. It was such a blessing to be in a place with other sold out Christians who like to dance and have fun. I don\u2019t think I got home that night until 5am, but it was worth it.

{"text": "REVIEW: EVERYDAY HEROES \u2013 A TALE OF SIN & SORROW (2020)\nI guess it\u2019s the way of the world, and certainly I am as guilty of this as anybody, but as I said to a mate of mine the other night on Twitter, when it comes to music I don\u2019t have a \u201cthing\u201d. I am always looking for the next thing.\nThat\u2019s cool, mostly, and it drives me to review so many records \u2013 and the day I stop searching for stuff is the day I pack in \u2013 but just occasionally it means you forget the wonderful bands you already know.\nThis, like the recent album from another South Wales band, Buffalo Summer, is one of those times.\nI first became aware of Everyday Heroes back in the Autumn of 2017 (they were a band of the day back then) and their EP\u2019s thus far have been superb, but when there is so much great music at the moment (and there really, really is) it is easy to forget that a band you had high hopes for at the time still hadn\u2019t put its debut record out.\nThey have now, and goodness me, it\u2019s good.\nYou know the sort of album it is from the moment it starts up. There\u2019s some vaguely southern rock about the riff. Black Stone Cherry are going to get mentioned in dispatches, or if you want to look a bit closer to home, then pretty much think of a more muscular version of The Answer, and you\u2019re there.\nThat opener is more than just a riff, though. Nope, \u201cTexas Red\u201d casts them as outlaws, on a steel horse they ride, the rock n roll gunslinger. You know the drill. So do they.\nYou could say \u201cFind My Way\u201d repeats the dose, but then they all do, and anyway that would be to miss the point. Instead revel in the spirit of it. The whole idea that \u201cit\u2019s a dangerous game with a high price next to your name.\u201d If rock n roll is about being on the wrong side of the law then this embodies that spirit. Plus Luke Phillips \u2013 who also sings \u2013 rips a solo out worthy of Richie Sambora.\nAnd if they are wanted (dead or alive)\u201d as it were, then the beefed up presence of Dan Richards on rhythm gives the likes of \u201cStanding Stones\u201d a heavy edge. Everyday Heroes enjoy a healthy love for the chorus too, which is always to be applauded.\nIt almost doesn\u2019t matter what \u201cThe Witches King\u201d is about, it sounds sleazy, simple as that, and there is a kind of effortlessly huge sound that comes naturally. \u201cSoul To Save\u201d is the type of pure hard rock fun that Phil Campbell And The Bastard Sons seem to do with equal ease (doubtless its tough, else everyone would be at it).\n\u201cVictorious (Take My Chains)\u201d is the one that goes full on southern rock, and you can blame this on the boom boom if you like, blame it on anything, but if there were festivals in 2020 then this would be ringing out of tents everywhere \u2013 and in future years I wouldn\u2019t rule EDH out of the main stages, either.\n\u201cAll Outta Faith\u201d has some bluesy balls, not a million miles from latter day Orange Goblin, not far from Clutch\u2019s punch, but yet not quite either. Rather it has a soaring harmony that suggests mainstream intent.\nLikewise, \u201cThe Crow\u201d does a power ballad thing. Partly, I am guessing because hard rock albums always did. It\u2019s more \u201cIll Be There For You\u201d than \u201cEvery Rose (Has It\u2019s Thorn)\u201d but it is expertly done and you can imagine Inglorious having a massive hit on Planet Rock with it.\n\u201cBreathe Again\u201d does the thing that I always love and starts with a guitar solo, while \u201cWest Of Forever\u201d rather pleasingly opens the colour pallet a little further. The inspiration for the record as a whole was a trip that Williams took to Spain to do the Camino Pilgrimage, and the touch of mariachi style trumpet here is just a hint at more to come. The last one, \u201cWithout A Throne\u201d, though is another slower paced one, but the sound of the guitars here, the intent throughout, is right from the top draw.\nThe beauty in this is that it isn\u2019t cutting edge. It is simply superb hard rock. It doesn\u2019t want to be anything else. It doesn\u2019t need to be anything else, but \u201cA Tale Of Sin And Sorrow\u201d is the work of a band with a mastery \u2013 and evident love \u2013 for what they do. \u201c\nREVIEW: TYLER FARR \u2013 ONLY TRUCK IN TOWN (2020)\nMORE CONFORMITY IN 2021"}

{"text": "What Is a Game?\nA game is a structured activity undertaken for pleasure, entertainment, or educational purposes. While work is often performed for monetary compensation, art is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. The two concepts are different, but the same thing applies to both. A game is a fun way to spend time with friends and family, and it is also beneficial to the community. To learn more, visit Wikipedia\u2019s article on games. para: A game can be defined as any structured activity, usually undertaken for leisure or entertainment. It can also be an educational tool, depending on its purpose. It is different from work, which is conducted for remuneration. It can be seen as a form of creative activity, whereas art typically focuses on aesthetic or ideological elements.\nA game can be defined by the type of activity it is designed for. Traditional board games are a classic example. They are formal systems with variable or quantifiable outcomes, which are influenced by the player\u2019s efforts. The player may feel happy when winning a game, while unhappy if he loses one. While it is unlikely that a game can be categorized as purely chance, it is often classified as a form of gambling.\nA game is a mental activity, and the purpose of the game is to stimulate emotions and relieve stress. Many games echo trials in real life, and their play can be a therapeutic activity for adults. In addition to being fun, games also serve as stress relief. A good game is a way to relax.

{"text": "The Savings Coach's virtual assistant and gaming features prove successful with first-time savers.\nUSAA, a financial services provider for more than 11 million current and former members of the U.S. military and their families, has teamed up with Nuance Communications to create Savings Coach, a proactive virtual assistant designed to help millennials save money.\nNuance's Nina virtual assistant technology is the foundation for the Savings Coach, which is available for mobile devices running on the Android and iOS platforms. The mobile app looks at users' purchasing behaviors, works with them to cut spending, and, through gamification, even challenges them to forgo some purchases as a way to save money. As users accomplish their individual savings goals, they are rewarded through points, badges, and new levels within the app. The app automatically takes the money that they would have spent and transfers it to their savings accounts.\nUsers can interact with the app by speaking, tapping, or typing, but Greg Pal, vice president of marketing, strategy, and business development in Nuance's Enterprise Division, says voice has proven to be a most effective input modality.\n\"We have found so far that speech is a nice way to engage with the app and bring the experience to life,\" he states. \"We've seen increased task completion with speech.\"\n\"Our mission is to help facilitate the financial security of our members, so we need to leverage technology to make it easier for members to track their finances and find new ways to save,\" said Eric Smith, vice president of technology architecture at USAA, in a statement. \"Savings Coach engages millennials through a conversational, simple explanation on the importance of saving, analysis of spending, and ongoing suggestions for a savings plan.\"\nDuring a four-month pilot, the nearly 800 participating USAA members, aged 18-24, collectively saved close to $120,000.\n\"Virtual assistants, like the one used in Savings Coach, are evolving to become much more personal and proactive in nature. We've seen the benefit proactive financial information can bring to our members through Savings Coach,\" Smith said.\nUSAA was the first financial services firm to leverage Nuance's Nina technology through its mobile application. The application, first introduced in August 2012, allows users to use speech to request balances, see how much they spent in the past week, when their next bill or loan payment is due, and more, rather than having to click through different pages in the app.\n\"Our collaboration with USAA is ushering in a new era of customer service where artificial intelligence and self-service merge to proactively provide information and add value to each customer engagement,\" said Robert Weideman, executive vice president and general manager of the Enterprise Division at Nuance, in a statement. \"USAA's use of our proactive virtual assistant is an example of how these assistants can, and will, become truly intelligent, adding a new layer of sophistication that moves beyond automation to deliver deeper, more personal interactions that further improve the customer experience and build loyalty.\"\nUSAA was the first bank to adopt the Nina Mobile virtual assistant technology when Nuance launched it in August 2012, Pal says. \"We've been working with USAA for quite a while now,\" he states. \"We have a very longstanding relationship with them that goes back about 10 years.\"\nOther financial services firms to introduce Nina apps include U.S. Bank, ING, and Turkey's Garanti Bank.\nAcross this broad customer base, \"customers are readily adopting self-service technologies, and they want those systems to be conversational, able to adapt to them, and as intelligent as possible,\" Pal says."}

The Skytrax survey measures quality standards across 41 key performance indicators of front-line products and services in the airline industry.\nThis is the fourth time Emirates has won the top accolade since the airline awards were introduced 15 years ago; the airline won the first ever Skytrax World\u2019s Best Airline in 2001, again in 2002 and in 2013. In total, Emirates has won a total of 20 Skytrax World Airline Awards since 2001.\nSir Tim Clark, President Emirates Airline, said: \u201cWe are honoured to be recognized by the prestigious Skytrax awards. Emirates has always put our customers at the heart of what we do, and we work hard to deliver the very best experience possible to our customers at every touch point, every day, all around the world. We constantly invest in our product and services, both on the ground and in the air. We listen carefully to our customers, and then relentlessly challenge ourselves to deliver and exceed expectations. The fact that these awards are based on the direct feedback from passengers is gratifying and wonderful recognition for all of the hard work that\u2019s gone into creating the Emirates experience.\u201d\nCommenting on the Award, Edward Plaisted, CEO of Skytrax said: \u201cThis fourth World\u2019s Best Airline title for Emirates is a fantastic achievement and true testament to the airline\u2019s popularity. To satisfy customers from such a wide and diverse passenger base is not an easy task, but Emirates continues to gain superlative feedback from customers for its product and service offering from the front to the back of the aircraft.

{"text": "Harry Potter in the Highlands\nThe Harry Potter series is probably the most famous to come out of Scotland, from its origins in Edinburgh to its filming locations over the country. Some of the most memorable scenes of the films were shot in the Highlands, from Hagrid\u2019s abode to the journeys on the Hogwarts Express. We have create a little visual guide to help you explore all our neighbouring landmarks for the true Harry Potter super fans out there!\nGlenfinnan Viaduct\nIn fact, Harry Potter features the Glenfinnan Viaduct near Fort William, most notably in the Chamber of Secrets when Harry and Ron are flying their car over it! And you can follow in tracks of the Hogwarts Express via the Jacobite Express with West Coast Railways. But hurry and do your research! It is only open for a short duration each year and gets fully booked so plan your journey in advance. And for goodness sake \u2013 don\u2019t miss the train!\nGlen Coe\nAlthough most of Hogwarts was filmed via CGI, certain locations in the most famous wizarding school were shot in the beautiful wild of the Highlands. Hagrid\u2019s Hut, where Harry, Ron and Hermoine often found refuge, was filmed in Glen Coe. The beautiful wilderness suited Hagrid and his home to his half giant bone. However, there is no neighbouring Forbidden Forest in Glen Coe!\nRannoch Moor\nSuper fans of Harry Potter would recognise Rannoch Moor as the location where Death Eaters board the Hogwarts Express in The Deathly Hallows, Part One. Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself if you can\u2019t though! Whilst the Death Eaters bring a sense of gloom and literal darkness to the surroundings, you won\u2019t normally find Rannoch Moor in that state. Strikingly beautiful, it is the perfect place to spend a day meandering through the moor or having a quick picnic.\nLoch Shiel\nHogwarts\u2019 Great Lake is a memorable feature from the grounds. From the Giant Squid throughout the books, the merpeople in the Goblet of Fire or simply the sweeping views of the Loch from the Astronomy Tower, it is worth also seeing in real life. The film used two different lochs to create the vast lake, one being Loch Shiel. Loch Shiel was used for Buckbeak\u2019s flight in particular and can be seen again when panned to from the astronomy tower. It is a beautiful Highland Loch in itself and it\u2019s surroundings, which is probably why the film team chose this Loch!\nEilean na Moine and Loch Eilt\nThis islet on Loch Eilt is meant to be Dumbledore\u2019s final resting place, where he is buried from the Elder Wand. Of course, this means that this is also where Voldemort takes the Elder Wand from Dumbledore. The popularity of Scottish Lochs for filming locations shows the magic of Scotland that might have inspired J. K. Rowling.\nActivities Film Harry Potter\nHarry Potter in the Highlands2019-08-282019-08-28https://www.thehighlandclub.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logo-base-1.pngThe Highland Clubhttps://www.thehighlandclub.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/glenfinnan-viaduct.jpg200px200px\nTravel essentials for your trip to The HighlandsActivities, Summer, Winter"}
{"text": "This winter, the city of Lucca will host a great event in the world of the arts. The exhibition on Pompeo Batoni (Lucca 1708 \u2013 Rome 1787), one of the greatest representatives of 18th century European art, will take place at Lucca\u2019s Palazzo Ducale, from December 6, 2008, to March 29, 2009.\nThrough this exhibit being held on the tercentennial of his birth, the city of Lucca pays homage to its illustrious citizen who went on to affirm himself on an international level,first in Rome and then in England, where he became one of the most sought-after painters by the British aristocracy. And it is the Anglo-Saxon world that dedicated two exhibitions to this artist in the course of 2008: first at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, Texas, and then at the National Gallery of London. Now, Lucca crowns this international itinerary by promoting the conclusive exhibit, the most complete not only in terms of quantity of works but also for the presence (next to portraits and profane subjects) of large-size paintings and spectacular altar pieces.\nThe exhibit, entitled \u201cPompeo Batoni: L\u2019Europa delle Corti e il Grand Tour\u201d (Europe of theNoble Courts and the Grand Tour\u201d, will consist of about 100 paintings by the Lucca artist, temporarily loaned for the occasion by the major public and private collections in Europe and the USA. Six sections comprise the exhibit, in a path to discover and re-visit the different phases of Batoni\u2019s long artistic career. The visit will follow a prevalently chronological criterion. And within the individual time periods, the themes and typologies elaborated by the painter will be highlighted. A series of furniture pieces and art objects will recreate the context and taste for the \u201cstudio painting\u201d, the genre connected to Batoni\u2019s fame.\nThe exhibition will be closed on December 25th and January 1st, 2009, and on Monday every week except for December 8th, 22nd and 29th and January 5th, 2009."}
{"text": "Russia detains more than 1,000 people in opposition crackdown\nReuters Moscow Jul 28, 2019, 09.47 AM(IST)\nLaw enforcement officers block protesters during a rally calling for opposition candidates to be registered for elections to Moscow City Duma, the capital's regional parliament, in Moscow, Russia July 27, 2019. Photograph:( Reuters )\nChants of \"Russia without Putin\" and \"Putin resign\" echoed through central Moscow as guardsmen clad in riot gear beat back protesters with batons and roughly detained people.\nRussian police rounded up more than 1,000 people in Moscow on Saturday in one of the biggest crackdowns of recent times against an increasingly defiant opposition decrying President Vladimir Putin's tight grip on power.\nThe detentions came around a protest to demand that opposition members be allowed to run in a local election. Authorities had declared it illegal and sought to block participation, but several thousand people turned up anyway in one of the longest and most determined protests of recent years.\nAt least one woman and a man appeared to have suffered serious head wounds.\nSaturday's events showed how activists and especially younger people remain intent on pressing to open Russia's tightly-choreographed political system to competition.\nJailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny had called the protest to persuade officials to allow opposition-minded candidates to run in a September 8 vote.\nAuthorities say they were barred because they failed to collect sufficient genuine signatures in their support.\nThe opposition has no seats in parliament and is starved of air time on state TV where many Russians still get their news.\nOpinion polls in the past have shown support for Navalny, a lawyer and anti-corruption activist, only in the single digits. But backers note he won almost a third of the vote in a 2013 Moscow mayoral race and say his movement could build momentum in the Russian capital if allowed to compete fairly.\nThough Putin's approval rating is still high at well over 60 per cent, it is lower than it used to be due to discontent over years of falling incomes. Last year, the 66-year-old former KGB intelligence officer won a landslide re-election and a new six-year term until 2024.\nBurnishing his man of action image, Putin spent Saturday diving to the bottom of the Gulf of Finland in a mini-submarine to honour a Soviet submarine that sunk there in World War Two.\nArrested 'sitting on a bench'\nOVD-Info, an independent monitoring group, said police detained at least 1,067 people before or at Saturday's protest. As in past sweeps, many were only held for a matter of hours.\nPolice put participation at more than 3,500 people, of whom it said around 700 people were journalists and bloggers.\nSome activists were arrested twice after being released and then returning to protest in a different place.\nOne of those detained, Alexander Latyshev, 45, said he had come from the nearby Vladimir region to discuss business with an associate and been randomly detained. \"I was just sitting on a bench (when they took me),\" he told.\nPolice also raided an office being used by Navalny's supporters to live-stream the protest.\nTV Rain, an independent station covering the protests, said its editor-in-chief had been called in for questioning.\nUnder Russian law, the location and timing of such protests need to be agreed with authorities beforehand, something that was not done for Saturday's event.\nKremlin critic Navalny was jailed for 30 days on Wednesday and other members of the opposition have had their homes searched. Ilya Yashin, a Navalny ally, said police had searched his Moscow flat overnight before detaining him and driving him out of the capital. He called for another protest next Saturday.\nKira Yarmysh, Navalny's spokeswoman, said on Twitter she had been detained on Saturday morning. Other prominent activists Dmitry Gudkov and Lyubov Sobol were also held.\nMoscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, a Putin ally, had warned beforehand that authorities would act decisively against the risk of \"serious provocations\".\nThe police's investigative arm has already opened a criminal investigation into an opposition rally in June which it said may have obstructed the work of Moscow's electoral commission.\nAn authorised protest in Moscow last weekend, also calling for the disbarred candidates to be registered, was attended by more than 20,000 people, according to the White Counter monitoring group.\nPole is 'sweet home' for South African man seeking to break own world record"}

Police investigate NSW Greens staffer after being outed as alleged serial rapist by survivors\nJune 23, 2017 Serkan Ozturk 0\nEXCLUSIVE: A 21-year-old high-flying political staffer in the NSW Greens who has publicly supported the party since he was seven-years-old is now under police investigation over alleged serious sexual assault offences, including rape.\n\u2013 WARNING: DETAILED DISCUSSION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND FIRST-HAND ACCOUNTS FROM SURVIVORS. FOR HELP, VISIT HERE \u2013\nThe NSW Police investigation into recently \u201csuspended\u201d NSW Greens campaigner, Jarah Crook, comes after Sydney-based journalist and rape survivor, Lauren Ingram, publicly outed Mr Crook over the social media service Twitter as an alleged \u201cserial sexual abuser\u201d operating within the left-leaning political party, going as far back as 2011.\nOne Greens member, who was a candidate at the 2016 federal election, has gone so far as to claim that Mr Crook was allegedly \u201cusing the party as his hunting grounds\u201d.\nMr Crook \u2013 who was \u201cindefinitely suspended\u201d by the Greens just a little more than three months ago \u2013 was due to leave Australia in just a few days on a long overseas holiday for which he has himself admitted he doesn\u2019t \u201chave a return ticket\u201d. It is unclear if Mr Crook will now be to able depart for the trip in late June as previously planned.\nThe self-described \u201cprovocateur\u201d was a paid campaigner for the NSW Greens for two months in 2015 and four months in 2016, before being suspended by the party in February 2017 after Ms Ingram filed an official written complaint. Ms Ingram alleges she was raped by Mr Crook in April 2015. Sources within the Greens insist however that there is no record of Mr Crook \u201cundertaking paid work\u201d for any of the sitting NSW Greens MPs. He has however had volunteer positions stretching back at least seven years. It is understood the Greens have failed to interview Mr Crook at-length about the matters after he allegedly abruptly left his home state of NSW in February when the official complaint was received by the party. Mr Crook has not responded to messages sent to him by True Crime News Weekly this week.\nSUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT JOURNALISM\nFollowing Ms Ingram\u2019s decision to go public, more young women, including writer Erin Riley, have come forward to share their accounts of being allegedly sexually harassed, assaulted or raped by Mr Crook. While it is also believed the NSW Greens were aware of Mr Crook as being allegedly involved in the sexual assault or harassment of at least four women going back to 2011. For some reason though, Mr Crook was allegedly promoted in the party into a position where he had access to membership databases and sensitive information, as well as potential access to young women and others.\nBruises and bite marks left after alleged violent rape (Image: Twitter / Lauren Ingram)\nMr Crook first came to some minor prominence in local political circles after launching a Twitter account in 2011 under the name, \u2018GreenAt15\u2018, where he would discuss how he was politically engaged and savvy about social issues despite his youth. The year before, it was reported that the then-14-year-old Greens activist got told off by the then-Labor Premier, Kristina Keneally, to \u201clet the adults talk together\u201d during the aftermath of the 2010 Penrith by-election in western Sydney.\n\u201cJarah may only be 14, but he\u2019s been handing out [Greens leaflets] since he was 7,\u201d The Tally Room website noted in its report of the evening\u2019s events.\nAn article published by The Point Magazinein August 2013 claimed Mr Crook had even back then created \u201ca large social media presence\u201d. In the same year, Mr Crook was also a participant in the \u2018Youth Parliament\u2019 which is like a simulation for young political boffins of the workings of the real NSW Parliament.\nJARAH CROOK FINALLY SPEAKS: EXCLUSIVE! \u201cI deny all the allegations\u201d: Alleged \u2018Greens rapist\u2019 threatens \u201clegal action\u201d over \u201churtful\u201d claims\nUPDATE: Accused \u2018Greens rapist\u2019 was being groomed as MP & had dreams of becoming Prime Minister\nRELATED: Greens likened to Catholic Church as star incoming federal senator Jordon Steele-John accused of \u201cpersistent\u201d sexual harassment\nA graduate in 2013 of Catholic boys high school, Holy Cross College Ryde in Sydney\u2019s north, Mr Crook then commenced tertiary studies at the University of NSW.\nIn 2014, Mr Crook was in Melbourne to celebrate the victory of Greens candidate, Sam Hibbins, for the blue-ribbon seat of Prahran in Victoria\u2019s Parliament.\n\u201cAn epic win\u201d: Jarah Crook (left) celebrates Greens MP Sam Hibbins (centre) winning the seat of Prahran in the 2014 Victorian state election (Image: Twitter / Supplied)\nA year later, the seemingly omnipresent Mr Crook was helping out Ballina Greens MP, Tamara Smith, on putting her official website together.\nIn December 2015, Mr Crook was then seen at the NSW Greens Christmas party where he was one of 100 guests at the Alexandria Hotel in Sydney\u2019s inner-west. The festivities made national headlines after former Liberal party leader and prime minister, Tony Abbott, entered the pub unaware that it was the location of celebrations for his political rivals.\nAt the time, Mr Crook himself was quoted by reporters saying \u201cit was weird\u201d to see the conservative icon in the heartland of the Greens.\n\u2018Posted by Jarah Crook\u2019: The NSW Greens say Mr Crook was never paid for any work on behalf of sitting MPs but in 2015 he was designing parts of the website for Ballina MP, Tamara Smith\n\u201cA couple of our MPs were there and they had no idea that Tony would rock up, let alone that Tony would have no idea who they were,\u201d Mr Crook told Fairfax Media.\n\u201cHe also made the rookie mistake of mixing beer and wine.\u201d\nAnd just last year, Mr Crook was one of the co-returning officers for the NSW Greens in the controversial pre-selection battle for the vacant NSW Upper House seat formerly belonging to John Kaye, which took place following his untimely death in May 2016.\nOn his now pulled-down website, Mr Crook went about by describing himself as a \u201cPhotographer. Campaigner. Provocateur\u201d.\n\u201cI create the moment and build movements,\u201d Mr Crook also boasted.\n\u201cThis website will visually document my 2017 travels across Europe and Central Asia, as I capture the art of both the natural and built environment.\u201d\n\u201cI create the moment and build movements\u201d: Jarah Crook\u2019s website which has since been pulled down\nSince Ms Ingram went public with her account and named Mr Crook as her alleged attacker, the former political operative has seemingly shut down almost his entire social media presence; including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts, as well as his website. Mr Crook\u2019s personal Facebook account still remains apparently active however.\nMs Ingram has said she was moved to go public with her own personal ordeal because it seemed that authorities such as the police and powerful institutions, even progressively-minded ones, were still not taking the experiences of sexual assault victims seriously.\n\u201cDespite my trauma, I was a \u2018good\u2019 victim. I went to the police only weeks after I was raped [in 2015]. The first officer I spoke to, a young man at the North Sydney station, was kind and professional,\u201d Ms Ingram said.\n\u201cBut the matter was referred to the station closest to where I was assaulted, and I was assigned a male detective who made me feel even worse.\n\u201cThe first time I met with the detective, to do a formal interview, he told me my rapist was \u2018just a kid who didn\u2019t know how to have sex yet\u2019. He treated me like I didn\u2019t matter, like somehow I could have prevented this from happening.\u201d\nMs Ingram further alleges the investigating detective failed to collect basic evidence and retrieve hospital records. It is believed the detective in question is from the Kings Cross police station in Sydney\u2019s inner-city.\nSURVIVOR LAUREN INGRAM SHARES TRAUMA TO PROTECT OTHER WOMEN\nMs Ingram is a respected journalist who has been published by the likes of News.com.au, Fairfax, Junkee, Birdee Mag and the Daily Mail Australia. In a series of Twitter messages on Sunday, June 18 that quickly went viral, Ms Ingram sparked widespread outrage and calls for action after detailing an alleged violent sexual assault she had survived.\n\u201cSince I decided to go public with what happened to me on social media, I have been contacted by five other women who were harassed or assaulted by the man who raped me,\u201d Ms Ingram said.\n\u201cSome have said they complained to the Young Greens about his behaviour six years ago and were ignored.\u201d\nMs Ingram has since written a painfully honest and traumatic account of the alleged rape and an expose of its aftermath for News.com.au.\n\u201cI WILL always remember April 25, 2015. The day I was raped,\u201d Ms Ingram writes.\n\u201cI met the man who raped me only a couple of months after I moved to Sydney. I didn\u2019t know very many people in the city and he was friendly, both online and off. I considered us friends, and he was a member of the NSW Greens and other progressive circles people I knew were a part of.\n\u201cOn Anzac Day I had been out socialising with friends and he messaged me, inviting me to hang out at his house and have pizza. I arrived, we ate and had a drink. Then he started kissing me.\n\u201cThe sex started out as consensual. But then quickly he started to get rough. I said \u2018ow\u2019 and he kept going. I told him to stop, please, and he held me down, bit me and hit me.\n\u201cWhen he was done, I got up, shaking. He was suddenly angry again, asking me where I was going. I said to the bathroom, where I sat for a minute and tried to work out what to do. I came out and he was waiting by the door, telling me to come back to bed. I lay awake, terrified, for the next several hours, trying to work out how to escape.\nAlleged serial sex offender, Jarah Crook, at NSW Parliament (Image: YouTube / YMCA)\n\u201cWhen the sun rose I said I had to leave. He said we should \u2018do this again some time\u2019. I got in an Uber home and cried, wanting to go home and scrub my skin until I couldn\u2019t feel his touch anymore.\n\u201cDuring the journey I messaged two friends, saying I was hurt and scared and didn\u2019t know what to do. Immediately they came to my house, and convinced me to go to the hospital.\nLauren Ingram with a sign about her alleged rapist at the Women\u2019s March in Sydney in January 2017 (Image: Twitter / Lauren Ingram)\n\u201cEven the doctor, who was a specialist and had to be called in, was shocked at the extent of my internal and external injuries. She documented my bruises and swabbed me, took blood to test for STIs and gave me the morning after pill.\n\u201cBut what has brought almost as much pain as the violent abuse I was subjected to that night is how the institutions that claim to care about violence against women let me down when I reported what happened to me.\u201d\nWRITER ERIN RILEY REVEALS PERSONAL TRAUMA TO BACK ALLEGATIONS\nThe NSW Greens have in response to the growing outrage released a media statement, saying the party will be conducting an internal report on the handling of the complaint regarding Mr Crook.\n\u201cThe Greens NSW are in the process of reviewing and strengthening policies and mechanisms for dealing with sexual assault, violence and harassment,\u201d the statement reads.\n\u201cRegarding the incident that was discussed on social media on the 18 June 2017, the Greens NSW first received a formal complaint on 16 February 2017 and the member was formally and indefinitely suspended on 20 February 2017 and all member rights were removed. We also understand that the incident was reported to the police.\n\u201cWe are devastated for the woman involved and are extremely concerned to ensure everyone\u2019s emotional and physical safety within our party.\u201d\nMeanwhile, NSW Greens MLC Jeremy Buckingham has stayed silent on \u201chis friend and colleague Jarah Crook\u201d despite being openly queried by Ms Ingram on what he \u201chas to say\u201d about the matter.\nIt is thought that Mr Crook harboured ambitions of his own to one day be an MP and was likely being groomed by elements of the party for a future parliamentary position.\nOther high-profile MPs within the NSW Greens however, such as the party\u2019s police and justice spokesperson, David Shoebridge, have moved to confirm that Mr Crook never worked with them.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a person I\u2019ve ever worked with, and I understand he has now been indefinitely suspended from the Party,\u201d Mr Shoebridge said over Twitter on June 19.\nJarah Crook: A \u201cfriend and colleague\u201d of Greens MLC Jeremy Buckingham, according to rape survivor Lauren Ingram (Image: Youtube / YMCA)\nIt is believed that Mr Crook has been politically aligned with the more conservative faction in the NSW Greens, a grouping which includes Mr Buckingham and Mr Kaye\u2019s eventual replacement \u2013 Greens MLC Justin Field. The spat about the direction of the party in NSW has seen public attacks made on the likes of Mr Shoebridge and federal Greens Senator, Lee Rhiannon, from supporters of the more conservative faction.\nPerhaps partly as a result of internal squabbling, it has emerged however that the NSW Greens were largely ill-equipped to deal with allegations of sexual assault or harassment committed by its own staff or volunteers. Members have stated in the past week that until Ms Ingram\u2019s formal complaint in mid-February of this year was received, that \u201cthere wasn\u2019t actually a process\u201d in place.\n\u201cThe women of NSW Greens wrote and instituted one in response to these kind of issues, especially related to the alleged perpetrator, around the time of his suspension,\u201d a NSW Greens member said.\n\u201cAt this stage it\u2019s unclear if other Greens state branches have grievance mechanisms or sexual harassment policies but if they don\u2019t, they can at least adapt or adopt NSW\u2019s now. Each state should be discussing and examining this, closely and thoughtfully.\u201d\nNSW Police have informed True Crime News Weekly that a new investigation into the sexual assault allegations has been commenced after the firestorm of debate that was sparked by Ms Ingram\u2019s comments over Twitter.\n\u201cNSW Police have reached out to a Sydney woman via a social media channel for more information about an alleged sexual assault,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nA few hours later, the spokesperson confirmed to True Crime News Weekly that \u201cpolice are investigating\u201d the allegations.\n\u2014 UPDATE \u2014 On August 4, six weeks after True Crime News Weekly contacted him for the first time with a series of questions, Mr Crook finally sent a response about the allegations made about him.\n\u201cI deny all the allegations,\u201d he wrote in an email addressed to True Crime News Weekly.\n\u201cI will be perusing legal action because this has been hurtful for my friends and family.\n\u201cIn Australia, justice is served through our established justice system. It can not be served through social media lynch mob.\n\u201cI expect you to include a version of the above in the stories published online.\u201d\nNOTE: True Crime News Weekly has elected to identify the alleged offender due to apparent systemic failures in organisations that are meant to protect and serve the community, as well as the alleged offender\u2019s plans to leave Australia indefinitely.\nSHARE THIS TRUE CRIME STORY\nAbout Serkan Ozturk\t113 Articles\nSerkan Ozturk is an investigative journalist and the publisher and editor of True Crime News Weekly.

{"text": "11-4-13; Is the IL State Chamber Judicial Activism Report \"Unfair\"??; Bad Personal Habits are Clearly Compensable for \"Travelers\"; Matt Ignoffo Reviews Important Contribution Ruling and much more\nSynopsis: Is the IL State Chamber Judicial Activism/Legislative \u201cInactivism\u201d Report Fair or Unfair?\nEditor\u2019s Comment: We obtained and carefully read the seminal treatise from the IL State Chamber titled The Impact of Judicial Activism in Illinois\u2014Workers\u2019 Compensation Rulings from the Employer\u2019s Perspective. We salute IL Chamber President Doug Whitley and Kathleen Bruns for drafting it. As we advised our readers last week, it is a \u201cmust-read\u201d for all Illinois risk managers/claims handlers if you want to understand why our WC system is so challenging. If you want a copy of the report, surf to www.ilchamber.org; for clients of our firm, send a reply and we will get you a copy.\nOur favorite passage is:\nIn conclusion, the essence of Illinois\u2019 troubled workers\u2019 compensation system is two-pronged (1) unfettered judicial discretion in interpreting the workers\u2019 compensation law with the clear objective of expanding compensability of workers\u2019 compensation claims; and (2) the failure of the Illinois General Assembly to pass legislation clearly expressing legislative intent and parameters of effectuation the provisions of the Act with the objective of ensuring the workers\u2019 compensation system in Illinois is fair, predictable and benefits employers as well as injured workers.\nWe also read a quote from outgoing Illinois Workers\u2019 Compensation Lawyers Association President Frank Sommario in www.workcompcentral.com where he says:\nWhether WCLA members agree or disagree with a particular decision, we all agree that the Justices of the Appellate and Supreme Courts are diligent and hard-working judges, who apply the law impartially to the facts presented to them and who handle these extra workers\u2019 compensation duties voluntarily in addition to their regular caseload.\u201d Sommario said, \u201cin our view, it is extremely unfair for the Chamber to draw such broad negative conclusions based on 17 cases out of the over 1,000 workers\u2019 compensation cases that were decided by the Appellate and Supreme Courts during the period covered by the Chamber report.\nWe want to reply to highly respected WCLA President Sommario with our three different concerns/objections. First, IL Supreme and Appellate Court justices are among the best paid in the United States with guaranteed annual pay raises and generous pensions that also go up every year. We are certain they are diligent and hard-working and thank them for their intelligence, dedication and service.\nAs to the 17 cases out of a thousand being analyzed by the State Chamber report, we point out the IL State Chamber review analyzed the biggest cases\u2014they looked at the rulings that formed the other 983 cases considered during the period of their analysis. By that we mean, prior to the E.R. Moore v. Industrial Commission ruling, IL WC didn\u2019t have \u201codd lot\u201d total and permanent disability claims. The IL WC Act doesn\u2019t have an definition for the words \u201codd lot.\u201d Due to the lack of a definition or any mention of the term, one could infer our legislature didn\u2019t intend to provide the rights or responsibilities that come with this very, very expensive lifetime, tax-free benefit. The IL Supreme Court and Appellate Court rulings that create new laws like this foster ambiguity that generates more and not less certainty in what is supposed to be a simple and easy-to-understand area of benefits.\nFor an even better example, in the words of the IL State Chamber report, when our \u201cunfettered\u201d reviewing courts judicially \u201ccreate\u201d a legal concept, we are all left to guess what they mean by it. That generates lots more litigation to delve into the boundaries of the new hypothesis. For one simple example, the 1990 Edward Hines Lumber ruling judicially added overtime to the IL average weekly wage in contradiction to what we feel is the simple language in Section 10 of the Act. That ruling led to a 1996 decision named Ogle v. IIC which led to the Edward Donruling in 2003 which led to Freesen, Inc. v. IIC in 2004 with the most current statement in this line of overtime rulings being the 2007 decision in Airborne Express v. IWCC. At present, IL workers are required to demonstrate overtime has to somehow be \u201cmandatory\u201d which is another term not defined in Section 10 of the Act.\nRegardless of your feelings about this plethora of rulings, our point is judicial activism creates more judicial involvement. As the IL State Chamber report accurately notes the IL General Assembly then effectively sits on their hands and does nothing to provide any guidance as to what to do about the new judicial models.\nAside from the new and unprecedented \u201ctraveling employee\u201d concept, perhaps the simplest and most controversial legal ruling from an reviewing court your editor has ever read is Durand v. IWCC. In Durand, the worker admitted she suffered from carpal tunnel for four years and the IL WC Act required her to file the Application within three years\u2014she admitted she didn\u2019t do so. If you teach any schoolchild the law, it is our view such a claim should be denied 100 out of 100 times. We simply don\u2019t see any \u201cwiggle-room\u201d or a path around the clear statutory language. In considering the facts of the claim, our highest court wrote they weren\u2019t going to \u201cpunish\u201d her for supposedly working with pain until the statute of limitations ran. What worker couldn\u2019t make the claim they \u201cworked with pain?\u201d If you aren\u2019t certain, such a ruling eviscerates the plain language in Section 6 of the IL WC Act. As court-watchers, we now have literally no idea when and how the statute of limitations might apply moving forward but we can be certain there may be lots more litigation over this previously simple and straightforward provision of the Act.\nOur problem with that ruling and the 16 other such rulings outlined in the IL Chamber Report is they distill the frustration of all Illinois businesses in dealing with the ostensibly simple system of workers compensation benefits\u2014the law is the law; if you follow the simple rules, you get what the law provides.\nPlease also remember the new Chief Justice of the IL Supreme Court is the revered Rita Garman who is a Republican. To the extent the Court she now leads picks the five-member Appellate Court, Workers\u2019 Compensation Division, as a voice for Illinois business, we would love to see some new blood on this five-member panel with at least one or two members who have a strong pro-business focus. It is our opinion all five members of the current panel are excellent and knowledgeable jurists but not one of them strictly construes the IL WC Act or has a strong business focus. It is our reasoned opinion they all speak with a single voice of judicial activism in the interests of Illinois labor. It has been literally decades since there was a member of this panel that wrote a strong dissent.\nSynopsis: Yes, Folks, Lung Cancer, Cigarette Smoking and Lots of Personal Conditions and Bad Habits are Now Work-Related But Only For \u201cTravelers.\u201d\nEditor\u2019s comment: We had many long-time readers object to our conclusion in last week\u2019s lead article. They assert the personal and bad habit of cigarette smoking cannot possibly be work-related for the millions of workers who now fit the wildly expanded definition of \u201ctraveling employees.\u201d The main objection from our readers was the deleterious condition has to be \u201ccausally connected\u201d in a fashion our courts aren\u2019t requiring.\nFour Appellate Court, Workers\u2019 Compensation Division rulings, several of them now final, find IL employers now owe for all \u201creasonable and foreseeable\u201d activities of \u201ctravelers.\u201d We note the first case remains pending before the IL Supreme Court and was orally argued more than six weeks ago. We hope for a ruling from the Court by the end of this year.\nIn Admiral Mechanical v. IWCC, the Appellate Court ruling says:\nThe traveling employee retains the burden of proof regarding causation. Hoffman v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, 109 Ill. 2d 194, 199 (1984). That burden is met where the employee shows his or her conduct was reasonable and foreseeable. Cox, 406 Ill. App. 3d at 545-46.\nIn Venture-Newberg-Perini Webster & Stone v. IWCC, Claimant Ron Daugherty\u2019s actions leading to injury were sitting in a car seat while his buddy was driving. Now his employer is on the hook for all his personal and non-work-related medical issues effectively for life. By the time of the hearing, he had over $1M in medical bills. If/when he passes, it will almost certainly be due to related problems and multi-million-dollar death benefits will be due.\n\u00b7 Let\u2019s assume Ron Daugherty was not in a car but riding as a passenger on a motorcycle. Riding on a motorcycle is \u201creasonable and foreseeable.\u201d The same accident would clearly be compensable under the same theories.\n\u00b7 Let\u2019s assume the same motorcycle didn\u2019t crash but went over a lot of hard bumps and he developed intractable low back pain. Despite the absence of a \u201cwork-related accident,\u201d the court\u2019s new rulings make such \u201crepetitive-trauma\u201d back pain with medical care and lost time and permanency the responsibility of the employer, even though the true cause has literally nothing to do with work.\n\u00b7 Let\u2019s assume he was riding on a motorcycle and got bit by a West Nile mosquito which is a risk common to everyone. If all he has to do is prove his actions in riding the bike are \u201creasonable and foreseeable\u201d he is entitled to full WC benefits.\n\u00b7 Let\u2019s further assume he was riding as a passenger on a motorcycle and didn\u2019t dress properly for a cold November day. He develops pneumonia from riding on the motorcycle and his doctor said the lack of proper clothing caused the pneumonia. The new rulings make that illness and its sequalae the responsibility of the employer. Medical care, lost time and permanency would be due. If he were to pass from that now-compensable medical condition, it would clearly be a death claim.\nUnder the same reasoning, bad personal habits like smoking cigarettes, texting while driving, not dressing properly to account for cold or rainy weather, wearing six-inch high heels or other unsafe personal footwear, smoking in bed and lots of other unsavory or questionable personal activities are \u201creasonable and foreseeable,\u201d causally connected to work and compensable. All such activities are now compensable for \u201ctravelers\u201d\u2014at the same time, there is no such coverage for \u201cnon-travelers.\u201d\nAs a challenge to our readers, if you feel the IL employer is not responsible for everything a \u201ctraveler\u201d does from when they leave their house until they return including bad/dangerous personal habits and bad clothing, you tell us what is and isn\u2019t \u201ccausally connected.\u201d\nPlease note all prior legal definitions of \u201ctraveling employees\u201d are about business people on business trips where the employer is paying them for foreign travel and reimbursing expenses. Ron Daugherty, Stanislawa Mlynarczyk and the other folks recently found to be \u201ctravelers\u201d were injured off the clock and miles from their jobs. They weren\u2019t being paid expenses or compensated during travel.\nIn our view, this state can\u2019t possibly make employers responsible for injuries, illnesses and deaths for personal risks and bad habits. It doesn\u2019t make sense and can\u2019t be made to make sense. If you want to be mad at us for talking about it, go ahead but we aren\u2019t causing this impossible-to-sustain concept.\nWe appreciate your thoughts and comments.\nSynopsis: The Illinois Appellate Court Bars Defendant from Contribution/Indemnification claims in a later suit when such claims should have been alleged in the initial lawsuit filed by an injured worker. Analysis by Matt Ignoffo, J.D., MSCC.\nEditor\u2019s Comment: The underlying facts in Camper v. Burnside Construction involve Michael Camper, an employee of Neptune Construction, who fell and sustained injuries while working in a sanitary manhole on a construction site in Elgin, Illinois during January 2006. (No. 1-12-1589, October 28, 2013). Camper filed a four-count complaint against general contractors Burnside and Welch (Camper I). In Camper I, Camper alleged causes of action for construction negligence (count I) and premises liability (count II) against Burnside, and alleged two counts of product liability against Welch, as manufacturer of the manhole, under the theories of strict liability (count III) and negligence (count IV). Welch filed a third-party action for contribution against Neptune under the Joint Tortfeasor Contribution Act.\nCamper settled his claims against Burnside and Neptune. The settlement agreement stated that Neptune agreed to waive its claim for reimbursement under the Workers' Compensation Act (the WC lien). The court's February 13, 2009 order expressly stated the settlement between Camper, Burnside, and Neptune was made in good faith pursuant to the Joint Tortfeasor Contribution Act; that Camper's action against Burnside, and Welch's third-party action against Neptune, were dismissed with prejudice; and that the court \"bars any actions for contribution by any other defendants or tortfeasors against Burnside or Neptune.\" Camper's cause of action against Welch was to continue on as Welch was the sole non-settling defendant in Camper I.\nOn April 22, 2009, Camper voluntarily dismissed his complaint against Welch without prejudice. On February 5, 2010, Camper refiled his cause of action against Welch only, by alleging the same two counts of product liability based on strict liability (count I) and negligence (count II) (Camper II). On May 19, 2010, Welch filed a two-count third-party action, seeking contribution (count I) and \"indemnification/breach of contract\" (indemnification claim) (count II) against Neptune. Neptune filed a section 2-619 motion to dismiss Welch's third-party complaint for contribution and indemnification on the basis that the claims were barred by res judicata.\nIn separate orders the Circuit Court dismissed Welch\u2019s contribution (count I) and indemnification (count II) claims against Neptune and Welch appealed.\nUnder section 2-619 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, an action may be involuntarily dismissed on the bases that \"the cause of action is barred by a prior judgment\" under a theory of res judicata, or that \"the claim asserted against the defendant is barred by other affirmative matter avoiding the legal effect of or defeating the claim.\" The doctrine of res judicata provides that a final judgment on the merits rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction bars any subsequent actions between the same parties or their privies on the same cause of action. Three requirements must be satisfied in order for res judicata to apply:\n1. a final judgment on the merits has been reached by a court of competent jurisdiction;\n2. an identity of cause of action exists; and\n3. the parties or their privies are identical in both actions.\nRes judicata bars not only what was actually decided in the first action, but also those matters that could have been decided in that lawsuit.\nWith regard to Welch\u2019s contribution claim (count I) against Neptune the Court only needed to decide the \u201con the merits\u201d requirement as the second and third requirements were satisfied here. It noted, generally orders dismissing an action with prejudice constitutes a final judgment on the merits for the purposes of res judicata.\nWelch's original third-party contribution claim in Camper I was dismissed for a reason other than for lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join an indispensable party. The Court found the February 13, 2009 dismissal with prejudice of Welch's Camper I third-party contribution action against Neptune was an \"involuntary\" dismissal and, thus, operated as an adjudication upon the merits. Camper's settlement with Burnside and Neptune in Camper I was a final judgment on the merits for the purposes of res judicata, where the parties agreed to a resolution and the Circuit Court dismissed with prejudice Camper's action against Burnside and Welch's original contribution claim against Neptune.\nWith regard to Welch\u2019s indemnification claim (count II) against Neptune, as the \u201con the merits\u201d requirement was now met and the identical parties requirement was met the Court only needed to determine whether the indemnification claim (count II) sought by Welch in Camper II has an \"identity of cause of action\" with the contribution claim sought by Welch in Camper I.\nIllinois applies the more liberal \"transactional test\" in determining whether identity of cause of action exists for the purposes of res judicata. Under the transactional test, separate claims will be considered the same cause of action for purposes of res judicata if they arise from a single group of operative facts, regardless of whether they assert different theories of relief. To determine whether there is an identity of cause of action between the first and second lawsuits, a court must look to the facts that give rise to plaintiff\u2019s right to relief, not simply to the facts which support the judgment. An identity of cause of action is established if two claims are based on the same, or nearly the same, factual allegations.\nWelch argued the Camper I contribution action was a cause of action arising out of potential tort liability, while the Camper II indemnification claim was based upon contract liability. Welch further asserted the contribution claim and the indemnification claim relied upon two different sets of factual allegations for support.\nThe Court held regardless of the fact Welch's contribution claim in Camper I and the indemnification claim in Camper II assert different theories of relief against Neptune, both actions relied upon the circumstances surrounding Camper's accident. Welch's Camper II indemnification claim against Neptune arose from the same group of operative facts as its Camper I contribution action against Neptune. Both actions arose out of the injuries suffered by Camper when he allegedly fell while working. As all three elements of res judicata were satisfied the Court held the indemnification claim (count II) was barred. The Circuit Court judgment was affirmed.\nWe can learn from this holding that any and all claims need to be addressed prior to settlement agreements and orders being entered. Claims should be alleged as early as possible or they may be barred. Extensive litigation was pursued in this matter in an attempt to bring claims which likely had value, but procedural issues precluded them from being heard by a trier of fact.\nThis article was researched and written by Matthew Ignoffo, J.D., M.S.C.C.

In 1960, six years after divorcing her first husband, she married Arie Eshel, like herself an employee of the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She counts his daughter, Ruth, as her own.\nTamar Eshel grew up in Haifa, where she studied at the Reali School and was active both in the Scout movement and in the Haganah. She attended the University of London, where she took Arabic and Middle Eastern Studies, and at the same time served as a radio operator at the Haganah\u2019s illegal radio station. During World War II she volunteered for the British army and served first as a driver and then as a supervisor of the establishment of military educational libraries in the Middle East. In both London and Egypt she was a counselor for the Habonim and He-Halutz movements. Upon discharge from the British army she became an officer in the political and military intelligence service of the Haganah in Jerusalem and after the 1947 UN decision on Palestine was sent to Europe to engage in arms purchase and illegal immigration operations. She was in charge of Lit. \"ascent.\" A \"calling up\" to the Torah during its reading in the synagogue.Aliyah Dalet in Marseilles and, after the pogrom in Oujda in June 1948, was sent to Algeria in order to organize the mass flight of Jews from Morocco and Algeria.\nIn 1950 Tamar joined the Israel Foreign Ministry, initially working in its research department and then as the manager of the office of the ministry\u2019s director-general. In 1955 she was appointed a member of Israel\u2019s permanent delegation at the United Nations and for many years represented Israel both at the UN General Assembly and in various other UN bodies, with the rank of ambassador. Among her areas of specialization were human rights and technical assistance. Elected to the UN Committee on the Status of Women, she became its chairwoman in 1961.\nEshel was twice seconded to the Prime Minister\u2019s office: first from 1958 to 1960 as director of technical assistance, at a time when the US government was making such assistance massively available to Israel, and again from 1964 to 1967, when she served as secretary of the National Council for Research and Development.\nIn 1960, while her husband Arie Eshel served as Israel\u2019s consul-general in New York, Tamar Eshel established the first office for Israeli academicians in the US and Canada. From 1962 to 1964, when he was ambassador to Brazil, she was put in charge of technical assistance between that country and Israel. After her husband\u2019s death in 1968, while he was ambassador in Canada, she decided to concentrate her activities in Israel and served first as the Foreign Ministry\u2019s adviser on political and church matters to Jerusalem\u2019s mayor, Teddy Kollek.

{"text": "Coller: 11 things we'll be watching at Vikings camp\nFinally training camp is here.\nAfter cancellations of offseason activities and delays to get camp started, the Minnesota Vikings are working out at TCO Performance Center and Friday marks the first time reporters will be allowed to view practice. With camp kicking off, here\u2019s the top storylines we will be watching the closest\u2026\nCOVID camp\nAs much as we are all worn down by it, the No. 1 storyline in every camp around the NFL is COVID-19. The league faces the monumental task of keeping the virus out without a bubble but the phonebook of protocols has players being tested daily, socially distancing around the facility and holding lots of virtual meetings in attempts to stave off the pandemic shutting things down.\n\u201cEverybody from the staff from the players when you go home you have to have just as much responsibility outside the building as you do inside the building so I think the NFL and the NFLPA have done a great job trying to put this protocol in place and we have to be disciplined enough to follow all of this protocol,\u201d general manager Rick Spielman said this week.\nBeyond the challenges of maintaining the health and safety of an 80-man roster and dozens of coaches and team employees, the Vikings\u2019 staff will be forced to evaluate players in a very tiny window of time before making final cuts. While veterans have said that their bodies did not miss being subjected to offseason workouts, OTAs and minicamp, young players on the bubble did not have a chance to make early impressions and won\u2019t have preseason games to shine when the lights are bright.\n\u201cThe most difficult thing is we can go out there and practice guys see the same plays all the time but then they go out there in a preseason game and see plays they haven\u2019t seen before and you have to see how they react and how they move and how they think on the field without a coach telling them,\u201d head coach Mike Zimmer said.\nEven in a normal year evaluations are challenging. Zimmer used the example of the Vikings cutting projected starting defensive end Ifeadi Odenigbo in 2017 and 2018 as proof that teams can miss on a quality player. This year\u2019s camp will give the coaching staff the smallest sample size they have ever worked with. One bonus, however, is that they can have 16 players instead of 10 on the practice squad. The battles for those extra spots will be heated.\nDalvin Cook\u2019s contract\nIn June ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reported that Dalvin Cook would hold out if he and the Vikings didn\u2019t work out a new long-term contract. Through the first few days of walk-through and workouts Cook has been in attendance at TCO Performance Center. The question is whether he will participate in padded practices without a new deal.\n\u201c I know how important Dalvin Cook is and I know we\u2019ve been working closely with his agent, and we\u2019ll continue to work to try to see if there\u2019s a deal that we feel is not only fair to Dalvin but fair to us as well,\u201d Spielman said.\nWhat\u2019s fair appears to be debatable between the two sides. The value of running back contracts has not risen at the same rate as other positions in recent years and this summer\u2019s $16 million per year deal for Carolina\u2019s Christian McCaffrey may have put a cap on Cook\u2019s earning potential. There is also the element of the salary cap going down next year due to ticket revenue losses that may have the Vikings thinking closely about how high they\u2019re willing to go for the Pro Bowl running back.\nIn the past, the Vikings have aimed to open camp with a contract announcement (or three, in 2017). How long negotiations go into August will be something to keep an eye on.\nJustin Jefferson\nAdapting to the NFL is hard enough as a rookie receiver but first-round pick Justin Jefferson will likely be asked to overcome the truncated offseason to solidify a Vikings receiving corps that is minus its 2019 leading receiver (by far) in Stefon Diggs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting to see his body control, the way he\u2019s able to go down and get a ball, go up and get a ball, a ball\u2019s behind him and he\u2019s going and adjusting to that,\u201d receiver Adam Thielen said about the rookie. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty impressive, honestly. Excited to see him in person and to be around him more these next couple days just because, like I said, I\u2019ve seen a lot from afar. It\u2019ll be interesting, it\u2019ll be good to be around him more.\u201d\nOffensive coordinator Gary Kubiak said that he\u2019s working to catch Jefferson up to speed after he missed several days on the COVID/reserve list. Kubiak also noted that he\u2019s aware Jefferson\u2019s strength as a college receiver was playing out of the slot, which could end up being his role early on until he can master the entire offense. Whether he\u2019s running with the first team or not in camp will give us an indication of the former LSU star\u2019s starting point for his rookie year.\nWho\u2019s playing guard?\nThe Vikings surprised everyone earlier this offseason by releasing veteran Josh Kline, who started 13 games last season at right guard. Now at least one guard position is a wide open competition, according to Kubiak.\n\u201cWe have four of those guys back so we go right back with them and Dakota [Dozier] and [Aviante Collins] and Ezra [Cleveland] are working at the other spot,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cAs we line up today, we have four of our five back and somebody will end up playing the other guard position. We'll see what happens but it's going to be a very competitive nature through the course of camp. We have six weeks until we play a game and a lot to get done.\u201d\nThe other guard spot could be up for grabs as well. Last season Pat Elflein was 87th of 87 interior offensive linemen in pass blocking efficiency, according to Pro Football Focus.\nWhile we don\u2019t know who the starting five will be yet, one thing is clear: The Vikings did not go to the free agent market to replace Kline -- a decision that will be questioned if the interior of the line does not appear to be improved by the end of camp.\nThe cornerback carousel\nThis offseason saw all three of the Vikings\u2019 starting cornerbacks leave. Xavier Rhodes was released and Trae Waynes and Mackensie Alexander both opted to sign as free agents in Cincinnati.\nThat leaves three inexperienced corners in 2018 first-round pick Mike Hughes, 2018 undrafted free agent Holton Hill and first-round pick Jeff Gladney as the favorites to take over their spots with 2019 seventh-rounder Kris Boyd and third-round pick Cam Dantzler with a chance to force their way into the competition.\nThe fact that only Hughes has played in the NFL at nickel corner before makes the decision on starters even more difficult.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to still figure that out,\u201d co-defensive coordinator Adam Zimmer said. \u201cIt\u2019s still early. I think Mike [Hughes] has done a good job in the past for us, and he\u2019s really good at [nickel corner]. He also plays well outside.... We\u2019ll give a few guys an opportunity to see what they can do and, again, find the best combination and get the best players on the field.\u201d\nThe Vikings will have to make an educated guess on which players are most ready since they will not have a chance to see them in preseason action.\nReplacing Michael Pierce\nThe Vikings\u2019 biggest offseason acquisition Michael Pierce elected to opt out of the 2020 season due to health concerns, which leaves a huge hole (literally) along the defensive line. Pierce has been a dominant run stuffer with the capability of rushing the passer.\nIt may take multiple players to fill his role. Which players will be in that mix is yet to be determined.\n\"Shamar Stephen's done it before, and he's as good a nose as there is,\u201d Adam Zimmer said. \u201cHe's really good in the run game. He's an extremely smart player... Armon Watts played it a lot for us last year, and he played well. I think he's got the ability to play a couple positions inside for us. That's all going to shake out. Jaleel Johnson maybe can do it. We're going to rotate those guys around and see what's the best combination.\u201d\nLast week the Vikings attempted to trade for PJ Hall from the Raiders but he failed his physical and was sent back to Las Vegas. Will they add someone else off the free agent market if the coaches don\u2019t like what they see in early practices? Can Watts step up and go from playing 123 snaps last season to starting? Will someone else like Hercules Mata\u2019afa or fourth-round pick James Lynch emerge as a pass rushing option?\nKubiak\u2019s offense returns\nWhile the Vikings are changing offensive coordinators, they will be running the same offense under Kubiak. Will that help the offense gel together in short order?\n\u201cIt certainly helps, because we\u2019re not starting from ground zero,\u201d tight end Kyle Rudolph said. \u201cAnytime you enter a training camp, we always go back and start with install one, even though we may have gone through it all in OTAs and minicamp. So from that standpoint, as we go through meetings here in training camp, that doesn\u2019t feel any different. But it\u2019s important for us as an offense. Now we\u2019re able to kind of hone in on details of Gary\u2019s scheme and things that we can build on from last year.\u201d\nWhether that actually plays out throughout camp will be among the things to study in the coming weeks. The system may be the same and the teacher may be long proven but there are plenty of players who are either rookies or have expanded roles like Irv Smith Jr. and possibly Bisi Johnson or who didn\u2019t see much of the field last year like starting guard hopeful Dakota Dozier.\nThe pass rush\nLosing Everson Griffen in free agency to Dallas is significant. Now first-year starter Ifeadi Odenigbo will be asked to handle a heavy workload at right defensive end.\n\u201cWhat he cannot do is put pressure on himself that, \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got a chance to be a starting player, so now I\u2019m going to change my routine and change everything,\u2019\u201d co-defensive coordinator Andre Patterson said of Odenigbo. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst thing that he can do. All he\u2019s got to do is keep his focus on what he\u2019s done to get himself to this level that he\u2019s at right now and just keep improving and getting better and he\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d\nThe Vikings will look to either two veterans in Anthony Zettel and Eddie Yarbrough and/or rookie fourth-rounder DJ Wonnum and seventh-round pick Kenny Willekes to emerge as potential rotational players. Last year Stephen Weatherly and Odenigbo were strong in rotational roles but they each took several seasons before they were ready for those jobs. Will we be surprised by someone stepping up right out of the gate or will the Vikings need to sign someone off the free agent market?\nSituational football\nOne of the underrated hurdles that every team will face is preparing for every situation. Teams spend weeks and weeks of practice time working on goal line situations and two-minute drills etc. in camp. This year that will all have to be crammed into a couple weeks leading up to the opener at US Bank Stadium against the Green Bay Packers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to put them in as many game-like situations as we possibly can,\u201d Zimmer said.\nWhat will that look like exactly? How much time can they dedicate to those situations when time is limited?\nWho are the depth receivers?\nWe know Adam Thielen is the Vikings\u2019 No. 1 receiver and that Bisi Johnson and Justin Jefferson will be seeing significant playing time. After that, it\u2019s up in the air. Last year Alexander Hollins went from the last guy on the depth chart to the active roster and made several plays in the Week 17 game against the Bears.\nBehind him are plenty of contender for roles, including likely punt returner KJ Osborn, last year\u2019s seventh-round pick and potential deep threat Dillon Mitchell and Chad Beebe, who had a strong camp last season but got hurt in Week 2. Where free agent signee Tajae Sharpe fits in is unknown along with whether a long shot like UDFA Quartney Davis can make an impact.\nJake Browning vs. Nate Stanley\nThis one might not seem like a big deal -- and in past years the No. 3 vs. No. 4 quarterback battle hasn\u2019t meant much -- but teams will want to be secure in their quarterback depth chart in the case that COVID strikes.\nBrowning made a strong impression in camp last year and spent the entire season on the practice squad but the Vikings spent a seventh-round pick to grab Iowa\u2019s starting QB. They both could end up on the practice squad in 2020 but which player is more ready in the case of extreme emergency will be intriguing. How much practice time either player actually gets will also be notable.\nJustin Jeffersontraining campDalvin CookMatthew CollerMinnesotavikingsNFL\nColler: Dalvin Cook is doing his best Barry Sanders impression\nColler: What are realistic expectations for Justin Jefferson?\nColler: Lack of practices could make life tougher on Vikings\nColler: Stefon Diggs' success is a lesson for Vikings\nColler: Analyzing the Vikings' most difficult cutdown decisions\nColler: Vikings can afford to take the running back risk on Dalvin Cook"}

{"text": "Fantasy-FactionFantasy Book Reviews & Community\n#SPFBO 5\nSFF and Queerness \u2013 We Need To Do Better\nLiterary Devices: Foreshadowing\nIt\u2019s every high school English Lit teacher\u2019s first lesson on criticism, it seems. One of those things that\u2019s fairly easy to teach, understand, and look for, foreshadowing is, at its simplest, a literary device where the author gives hints or clues about plot developments that occur later in the story. I think most people who\u2019ve had even rudimentary courses on literary criticism are familiar with foreshadowing. But understanding foreshadowing as a reader is completely different from implementing it as an author, and if you aren\u2019t careful, your attempts at foreshadowing can actually make your stories very unsatisfying for your readers.\nIt\u2019s pretty easy to find detailed explanations of the different types of foreshadowing online, so I\u2019m just going to give you some tips and hints for layering elements of foreshadowing into your story. These are just suggestions to get you started\u2014they have unlimited potential to make your story fresh and powerful.\nChekov\u2019s Gun: This version of foreshadowing takes its name from Russian playwright Anton Chekov, who famously advised, \u201cIf in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired.\u201d You can use this advice for any object, obviously, and sometimes, you can plant very subtle and easily overlooked clues that readers might only pick up on a second or third reading. J. K. Rowling is a master at this technique, I think. For example, in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Rowling places a beetle in several scenes. It seems a strange thing to mention\u2014until we find out the beetle is the journalist Rita Skeeter in her alternate form!Rowling repeatedly uses objects to add depth, cohesiveness, and consistency to her stories.\nOften, the best way to employ this technique is after you\u2019ve written your first draft. During your revision process, look for moments where you can add objects or suggestions of objects that will come into play later in the story. The technique will also help you avoid the appearance of deus ex machina, the device where sudden and unexpected magic or power arrives to solve everything. If you use a magical amulet at the end of the story, the amulet should appear earlier in the story.\nProphecy: With apologies to my colleague Eric Christenson, who supplied a very thought-provoking article about fantasy clich\u00e9s a couple of weeks ago, I think prophecy is a very useful method of foreshadowing in fantasy. I\u2019m a \u201cwriting agnostic,\u201d as I\u2019ve said, and I think you should write what you want to write, whether other folks think it\u2019sclich\u00e9d or not. I think prophetic narratives still work because they speak to some kind of deeply rooted fear we all have that we aren\u2019t completely in control of our fates. Plus, as a reader, I often enjoy trying to figure out how a very vague prophecy can be fulfilled when a character seems to be going in a completely different direction.\nHere are just a few ways you can use prophecy to foreshadow:\n1) \u201cTrying to control prophecy\u201dor \u201cself-fulfilling prophecy\u201d narratives: These are as old as Oedipus, but on a basic level, they still work. In fact, Neil Gaiman even uses this technique in The Graveyard Book when he reveals that the order of Jacks tried to murder Bod when he was a baby because of a prophecy that said Bod would bring down their order. Because Bod escaped to the graveyard during the attempt, and because he grew up safe and sheltered, he lived to fight the order, eventually bringing it to an end. The act of trying to control prophecy actually ensured its fruition.\n2) Prophetic twists: Prophecies never have to be fulfilled verbatim\u2014they just have to be consistent with the wording of the prophecy, which can be open to vast interpretation in your story world. Maybe the prophecy says that a king will return on the night of the second blue moon of the year. Your story involves a gangster named King who returns to town the night the second location of the new Blue Moon Ale pub franchise opens in town. Fulfill the letter of the prophecy in unexpected ways.\n3) Terrifying prophecies that can\u2019t end well: One of my characters has a prophecy around him that involves his ultimate destruction, even though he\u2019s the hero. How can the hero come to an ultimate destruction? Does it mean defeat? Does it mean death? These kinds of prophecies will keep readers turning pages if they care about characters because they want to see what happens.\nOmens: Closely related to prophecies, but different in that they\u2019re less specific and more . . . well, ominous. A great example occurs near the beginning of A Game of Thrones, when Ned, Jon, Robb, Theon, and Bran find a litter of five direwolf pups with their mother impaled by a stag\u2019s antler. The direwolf is the sigil of House Stark and the stag the sigil of House Baratheon. They become even more ominous when Jon points out that there are five pups\u2014one for each trueborn Stark child\u2014and then finds a pure white pup some distance away. Six pups, six Stark children, one dead direwolf mother. We know things cannot work out well\u2014and they don\u2019t.\nAgain, if you know your omens ahead of time, by all means, write them in on your early drafts. However, this is sometimes easier for me on the revision. The first draft is for getting story down\u2014the second is for layering in setting and all the little clues I want to give my readers.\nForeshadowing should never be heavy-handed or painful\u2014UNLESS you\u2019re writing satire, which is a completely different animal. Also, be careful of \u201cred herrings,\u201d those pieces of foreshadowing that actually go nowhere. You can use them if you wish, but be aware of what you\u2019re doing and make sure that your readers aren\u2019t going to feel cheated when they find out your object, prophecy, omen, or whatever is just a fake out by you, the author. I think an admirable goal is to let your reader in on just enough to keep him or her turning pages and then desperate to go back to the beginning and start over to find all the clues you\u2019ve left.\nNext week: Allusion\nCheck Out Our Related posts:\nWriting Fantasy Songs: Part 3\nThe Language of Fantasy: An Introduction\nLiterary Devices: Allusion\nThe Fantasy Feminist: Part 2\nTags: Writer's Wednesday\nAmy Rose Davis Amy Rose Davis is an independent epic fantasy author.

A tawdry relative found in frame stories that forces me to dry-wretch and sets my skin a\u2019crawling. I\u2019m not sure if it has a name, if such a creature can be anything but Nameless, but this is an equivalent of author begging to the reader to continue reading, even though nothing of interest is happening. It all takes this form:\n\u201cThough the button on his waistcoat appeared like any other, it has ever etched itself on my memory. I had no way of knowing the gravity of its deadly import at the time, but the black button would come to chill my blood.\u201d\nPlease, gentle writers, stay on the correct side of the foreshadow and make sure your story has legitimate interest and tension, rather than vagaries that never amount to an ant\u2019s fart.\nAmy Rose Davis says:\nYes, I think that\u2019s one example that would fall under \u201cheavy-handed\u201d unless it\u2019s satire.

I didn\u2019t even realize that some of the means of foreshadowing you mention are actually foreshadowing. Brilliant.\nAE Marling, your point is also well made and one of my personal pet peeves. It\u2019s the effort of a lazy or unskilled writer to create tension by foreshadowing via explicit or implicit commentary. Build tension with deft story-telling, not charlatan tricks.\nCurtis Jobling says:\nGreat piece, Amy.\nI\u2019ve used foreshadowing throughout my Wereworld books, laying (hopefully subtle) teasers that won\u2019t pay dividend until later volumes. With my books being a fantasy series, I often get queries from overseas and copy-editors about the need for mentioning small facts that may not carry the narrative. I then have the rigmarole of explaining my reasoning (which my UK editor understands implicitly and instinctively, thank god).\nComing from a background in TV and film, I think the greatest trick is hiding the foreshadowing and avoiding the obvious MacGuffin. (See Mel Brooks\u2019 \u201cHigh Anxiety\u201d for the finest MacGuffin pastiche ever) \ud83d\ude42\n@CurtisJobling\nBiblibio says:\nInteresting post! I\u2019m actually not a big fan of the prophecy form of foreshadowing. It almost always falls on the heavy-handed side for me. Even when there are multiple possible interpretations, it\u2019s too obvious for my taste. I\u2019m a fan of subtle foreshadowing, the type that becomes apparent only after the act. I like foreshadowing that makes me appreciate a writer\u2019s ability to plan a story and to build it in an elegant fashion. Basically\u2026 subtlety is key.\nOkay, it\u2019s been bothering me like crazy that I didn\u2019t really make the Gaiman example clearer\u2026 What Gaiman did in The Graveyard Book was drop subtle hints about the prophecy here and there for the first 2/3 \u2013 3/4 of the book. THEN he told us about the prophecy through one of the Jacks. He foreshadowed the revelation of the prophecy and showed the results of the prophecy before we found out what the exact prophecy was.\nAnyway, I still maintain that *any* form of prophecy is a legitimate foreshadowing/literary device. Just because it\u2019s been used poorly or often in the past does NOT mean it can\u2019t be done well in your hands. \ud83d\ude42\nThanks for the great comments!\nMind Sieve 6/4/12 \u00ab Gloria Oliver says:\n[\u2026] Literary Devices: Foreshadowing from Amy Rose Davis.

[P] ARABIC | ITALIAN | JAPANESE TEXT VERSION PDF | SWEDISH\nAsked about the Israeli obsession to prevent neighbours \u2013 first and foremost Iran, but also Saudi Arabia and Egypt \u2013 from going nuclear, Hillel Schenker, co-editor of the Jerusalem-based Palestine-Israel Journal, told IPS, \u201cThis is primarily the work of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has built his political career on fanning the flames of fear, and saying that Israel has to stand pat, with a strong leader [him] to withstand the challenges.\u201d\nAnd this is the primary motivation for his upcoming and very controversial partisan speech before the U.S. Congress on the eve of the Israeli elections, which has aroused a tremendous amount of opposition in Israel, in the American Jewish community and in the U.S. in general, he pointed out.\nIran, which has consistently denied any plans to acquire nuclear weapons, will continue its final round of talks involving Germany and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia (collectively known as P-5, plus one).\nLast week, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani asked the United States and Israel, both armed with nuclear weapons, a rhetorical question tinged with sarcasm: \u201cHave you managed to bring about security for yourselves with your atomic bombs?\u201d\nThe New York Times quoted the Washington-based Arms Control Association as saying Israel is believed to have 100 to 200 nuclear warheads.\nThe Israelis, as a longstanding policy, have neither confirmed nor denied the nuclear arsenal. But both the United States and Israel have been dragging their feet over the proposal for a nuclear-free Middle East.\nBob Rigg, a former senior editor with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), told IPS the U.S. government conveniently ignores its own successive National Intelligence Estimates, which represent the consensus views of all 13 or so U.S. intelligence agencies, that there has been no evidence, in the period since 2004, of any Iranian intention to acquire nuclear weapons.\n\u201cIf Israel is the only nuclear possessor in the Middle East, this combined with the U.S nuclear and conventional capability, gives the U.S. and Israel an enormously powerful strategic lever in the region,\u201d Rigg said.\nHe said this is even more realistic, especially now that Syria\u2019s chemical weapons (CW) have been destroyed. They were the only real threat to Israel in the region.\n\u201cThis dimension of the destruction of Syria\u2019s CW has gone strangely unnoticed. Syria had Russian-made missiles that could have targeted population centres right throughout Israel,\u201d said Rigg, a former chair of the New Zealand Consultative Committee on Disarmament.\nA question being asked by military analysts is: why is Israel, armed with both nuclear weapons and also some of the most sophisticated conventional arms from the United States, fearful of any neighbour with WMDs?\nWill a possibly nuclear-armed Iran, or for that matter Saudi Arabia or Egypt, risk using nuclear weapons against Israel since it would also exterminate the Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories? ask nuclear activists.\nSchenker told IPS: \u201cI believe that if Iran were to opt for nuclear weapons, the primary motivation would be to defend the regime, not to attack Israel. Still, it is preferable that they not gain nuclear weapons.\u201d\nOf course, he said, the fundamental solution to this danger would be the creation of a Weapons of Mass Destruction Free Zone in the Middle East.\nThat will require a two-track parallel process: One track moving towards a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the other track moving towards the creation of a regional regime of peace and security, with the aid of the Arab Peace Initiative (API), within which a WMD Free Zone would be a major component, said Schenker, a strong advocate of nuclear disarmament.\nAs for the international conference on a nuclear and WMD free zone before the next NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty) Review Conference, scheduled to begin at the end of April in New York, he said, the proposal is still alive.\nIn mid-March, the Academic Peace Orchestra Middle East initiative will convene a conference in Berlin, whose theme is \u201cFulfilling the Mandate of the Helsinki Conference in View of the 2015 NPT Review Conference\u201d.\nIt will include a session on the topic featuring Finnish Ambassador Jaakko Laajava, the facilitator of the conference, together with governmental representatives from Israel, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Germany.\nThere will also be an Iranian participant at the conference, said Schenker.\nRigg told IPS Israel\u2019s first Prime Minister Ben Gurion wanted nuclear weapons from the outset. Israel was approved by the new United Nations, which then had only 55 or so members. Most of the developing world was still recovering from World War II and many new states had yet to emerge.\nHe said the United States and the Western powers played the key role in setting up the U.N.\n\u201cThey wanted an Israel, even though Israeli terrorists murdered Count Folke Berdadotte of Sweden, the U.N. representative who was suspected of being favourable to the Palestinians,\u201d Rigg said.\nThe Palestinians were consulted, and said no, but were ignored, he said. Only two Arab states were then U.N. members. They were also ignored. Most of today\u2019s Muslim states either did not exist or were also ignored.\n\u201cWhen the U.N. approved Israel, Arab states attacked, but were beaten off. They did not want an Israel to be transplanted into their midst. They still don\u2019t. Nothing has changed. \u201d\nGiven the unrelenting hostility of the Arab states to the Western creation of Israel, he said, Israel developed nuclear weapons to give itself a greater sense of security.\n\u201cIf Israel lost its regional monopoly on nuclear weapons, it would be vulnerable. So the U.S. goes all out to block nuclear weapons \u2013 except for Israel,\u201d he added.\nNot even Israel argues that Iran has nuclear weapons now.\n\u201cA NW free zone in the Middle East is simply a joke. If Israel joined the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), it would have to declare and destroy its nuclear arsenal.\u201d\nThe U.S. finds excuses to avoid prodding Israel into joining the NPT. The U.S. is effectively for nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, but successive U.S. presidents have refused to publicly say that Israel has nuclear weapons, he added.\nBecause of all this, a NWF zone in the ME is not a real possibility, even if U.S. President Barack Obama and Netanyahu are at each other\u2019s throats, said Rigg.\nSchenker said Netanyahu\u2019s comments come at a time when the 22-member League of Arab States, backed by the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) have, since 2002, presented Israel an Arab Peace Initiative (API).\nThe API offers peace and normal relations in exchange for the end of the occupation and the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and an agreed upon solution to the refugee problem.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that the danger of nuclear proliferation isn\u2019t a problem in the Middle East, said Schenker.\n\u201cAs long as Israel has retained a monopoly on nuclear weapons, and promised to use them only as a last resort, everyone seemed to live with the situation. \u201d\nThe challenge of a potential Iranian nuclear weapons programme would break that status quo, and create the danger of a regional nuclear arms race, he noted. Unfortunately, the global community is very occupied with the challenge of other crises right now, such as Ukraine and the Islamic State.\n\u201cSo it is to be hoped the necessary political attention will also be focused on the challenges connected to the upcoming NPT Review conference, and the need to make progress on the Middle Eastern WMD Free Zone track as well,\u201d he declared.

{"text": "I believe that in almost every case, employees of historic sites best serve the public when they strive to create an environment that is as historically authentic as possible.\nHere\u2019s an exception: The Chesapeake & Ohio Canal National Historical Park.\nThe C & O Canal towpath, near Sandy Hook, MD.\nThe C & O Canal, built between 1828 and 1850, served as an all-water transportation route from Georgetown to Cumberland, Maryland. A series of locks allowed canal boats to navigate the 184 miles. The national park service purchased the canal in 1938, after it ceased operation.\nThe canal follows the Potomac River.\nThe park is one of my favorite places. When I was a kid I attended a summer camp perched on a cliff above the canal, near Sandy Hook, Maryland. Later, I worked there. I hiked local stretches many times, often tromping down to Harpers Ferry. In 1981, a friend and I biked the entire towpath.\nMy friend Ruth (on left) and I pedaled from Cumberland to DC.\nThe park includes over 1,300 historic structures\u2014more than any other park in the system! And a few are fully restored. Visitors can experience a glimpse of life as it used to be on the canal at several lockkeepers\u2019 houses, and even take a canal boat ride at Georgetown or Great Falls. Rangers and volunteer interpreters provide a variety of programming.\nIt would be fiscally impossible for the the park service to rebuild or maintain every lock and historic structure along the way. But in some ways, the building foundations and now-gateless locks still found along the canal are even more evocative than the restored buildings. Who hauled those stones? Who tended these locks? What was life like in the heyday of canal travel?\nEvery ruin has stories to tell.\nThe fact that these remnants are not directly interpreted invite passers-by to wonder, and to imagine for themselves.\nDuring one of my early Wisconsin winters, I amused myself by writing my way back to the C & O Canal, and to nearby Harpers Ferry. That led to my first published book, The Night Riders of Harpers Ferry. One of the main characters, Mahalia, tends Lock 36 during the Civil War.\nA couple of weeks ago I had a chance to take a quick hike on one of my favorite stretches of the canal. I wandered back along the towpath from Sandy Hook to Lock 36. The ruin of the locktender\u2019s home, where Mahalia lived with her family in my novel, is more substantial than many along the canal. It is also tucked away among the undergrowth, being reclaimed by the forest, visible from the towpath and yet easily missed.\nMy character's home near Lock 36. In real life, the structure was severely damaged during a flood in 1936.\nAnd the environment? I saw orioles and butterflies, wildflowers and ferns, snapping turtles and frogs\u2026 and lots more, all within a mile or so.\nI like to imagine what the towpath looked like in its heyday, and I applaud the restoration work that still goes on along the canal. But I wouldn\u2019t want to see the trees cut down along all 184 miles of the towpath in order to simulate the period when tow ropes stretched from the canal boats to teams of mules trudging along the path.\nThe combination of history and greenspace is very special, just the way it is."}

After paying a toll to nowhere, nearly running out of fuel because there were no servo's, and then getting caught in a bad thunderstorm, I decided Greece didn't want us to leave. Tempers flared, and it was time to dry out and have a cup of tea while the thunder and lightning passed. Having wasted two hours, we continued on the correct road to the border. From there the road deteriorated and we were kept alert dodging potholes and lots of horse drawn carts until we reached Petrich, where we found a nice room for the night, with lock up storage for the bikes. Price was 20 Euro's, so fitted the budget. The people at the hotel recommended a restaurant nearby, where we had a huge tasty meal and a bottle of wine, total of 12 euro, Bulgaria was looking good!\n1-9th July\nWhile sitting eating our breakfast next to the bikes, I saw a small quad bike riding down the road. No lights, no number plate, old guy riding it had no helmet, and the muffler was falling off, so you couldn't miss it. No one even looked at him, this is normal here! Petrol was 1.19 euro a litre, about 35 euro cents cheaper than Greece. From Petrich we headed north to Sofia (where it was raining), along mostly good roads, then east to Motocamp Bulgaria, where the HU meeting was being held. Great time at the meeting, and at Motocamp, which became known as Hotel California, because it was so hard to leave! Polly, Ivaylo, and Doug really are great hosts. We met up with some old friends there, and made a heap of new ones as well. Graham Field and Sjaarc Lucassen were there, and we met up with Shane Smith (rtw shane), who we had been talking to for about 12 months on Facebook. There was a ride from Motocamp to Buzludzha, the former communist party headquarters building that looks like a UFO, which is well worth seeing. The weather at the top of the mountain was windy and cold, but OK further down.\nLyn inside the Buzludzha monument, lots of holes in the roof now.\nThe torches at the base of Buzludzha, which is hidden in the cloud behind us.\nWith Sjaarc Lucassen, that R1 and he have been just about everywhere.\nWhen is a Harley not a Harley? When it is Doug's Sportster/KTM/other. Very capable offroad.\nWe had a ball at Motocamp, relaxed, fitted new tyres to the bikes, serviced them, and resealed Lyn's forks, which had been weeping for a while. We rode into Veliko Tarnovo, (VT), the old capital of Bulgaria, really pretty city. It was warm riding, temperatures had been getting up to 42 degrees C. Another aussie turned up on a bike, Terry, from Coolum, just up the road from us in Queensland, it really is a small world.\nWe finally left Motocamp, heading for Turkey, the weather was a bit cooler today. The plan was to head east to the Black Sea, then go down the coast. As we headed further east, the country got flatter, and we copped really strong crosswinds, which made riding difficult for a while. We hit Burgas on the coast, then found a room in Ravda, just to the north. It is a beachside touristy town, but the room was nice, and only 13 euros, so we stayed two nights. We needed a charger adapter for Lyn's computer, and I needed a tyre pressure gauge, and Burgas was big enough to do some shopping in.\nThe Turkey / Bulgaria border going both ways. We saw both these views twice.............\nFollowing good road down to Marko Tarnovo, we approached the Turkey border. Fuel is cheaper in Bulgaria, so we filled the tanks, and got rid of our Bulgarian Lev. Arriving at the border, we found we didn't have enough cash for the insurance and visas, and as there was no ATM there, we had to cross back into Bulgaria, (which we had just cleared), and head back the 12 kms to town for enough cash to get across the border. Not wanting to take excess into Turkey, where they don't accept it, we got the right amount from the ATM. Clearing Bulgaria for the second time, the Turkish border visa and insurance guys upped the prices, and we were short again! After telling them what we thought of their ethics, the decision was made that seeing Turkey wasn't critical, and we went back into Bulgaria again. Following a different road, that was slow, narrow and potholed, that wound its way over a mountain range, we arrived at Carevo on the coast.\nWe found a hotel, and just up the road a seafood restaurant, where the food was the best ever. A bottle of wine and full bellies cost us 12 lev, about $9 aud.\nThe view from our hotel room in Carevo\nContinuing up the coast we road through Burgas and Ravda (again), up towards the border with Romania. It was fairly uneventful, except for a close encounter with a nut job in a Benz in Varna who cut across 2 lanes of traffic to take a call on his mobile, almost taking out a car as well. While stopped at a roadside cafe for lunch, we heard a sports bike coming from a couple of kms away, and it was screaming. As it came onto the straight near the cafe, the rider stood it up on the back wheel, and passed the two cars in front of him with the engine on the rev limiter the whole way! Very impressive, but suicidal! A straight forward border crossing into Romania further up the coast, and we booked into a hotel at Vama Veche, a small village on the coast just over the border that looked like it was a hippie hangout from the sixties. We had been talking to Terry, the guy from Coolum we met at Motocamp, and I went back to to the border and met up with him, and he joined us at the hotel."}

{"text": "hoakley May 24, 2018 General, Life, Painting\nErik Henningsen: the thirsty man\nErik Henningsen (1855\u20131930), The Thirsty Man (1900), lithograph poster for Tuborg Beer, 92.8 x 66.4 cm, location not known. Wikimedia Commons.\nIf you have ever enjoyed a cold Tuborg beer, you may be familiar with this classic poster advertising it. It is now the only well-known work by the Danish \u2018social realist\u2019 painter Erik Henningsen (1855\u20131930). This article looks at some of his other surviving work, which may not quench the same thirst, but was far more important at the time.\nHenningsen was born in Copenhagen, and his potential recognised early. His father, a grocer, had him apprenticed to a decorative painter, and he had private drawing lessons too. As a result, he was successful in being admitted to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1873. He graduated from there in 1877, and pursued a career as an illustrator as well as a painter.\nDuring the 1880s, he was a member of a group of realist artists who tried to encourage debate through their art, in the hope of creating a better society.\nErik Henningsen (1855\u20131930), Summum jus, summa injuria. Infanticide (1886), oil on canvas, 78.5 x 117 cm, The Hirschsprung Collection, Copenhagen, Denmark. Wikimedia Commons.\nHis first major painting appears to have been this, with the enigmatic title of Summum jus, summa injuria. Infanticide (1886). The Latin quotation comes from Cicero\u2019s De Officiis I, 33, and literally means the highest law, the greatest injustice. It is a warning still used that strict application of rights and the law carries the danger of doing some people a huge injustice, and Henningsen\u2019s narrative is an important example of a serious social and legal problem at the time.\nTwo labourers are digging a small pit at the side of a track across sand dunes. They are supervised by two policemen, one of whom keeps a written record. Behind and to the right is another policeman who holds a young woman by the elbow. She looks down as she is petting a dog.\nThe subtitle provides the clue as to what is going on. The labourers are trying to find the body of a baby, who is the subject of a police investigation. The young woman is the child\u2019s mother \u2013 unmarried, she had the baby in secret, smothered it at birth, and disposed of its body. She knows that if her baby is discovered, her punishment will be severe. But this was the only course open to her, as having a baby out of wedlock was against accepted religious and moral standards of the day.\nErik Henningsen (1855\u20131930), Farmers in the Capital (1887), oil, further details not known. Wikimedia Commons.\nThe following year, Henningsen courted less controversy with his Farmers in the Capital (1887). This shows a country family who have arrived in Copenhagen, complete with a large chest and their farm dog. Around them city-dwellers dress more fashionably, and stare at the outsiders with their rough clothing and filthy wooden clogs.\nErik Henningsen (1855\u20131930), The Dance Pavilion (1891), further details not known. Wikimedia Commons.\nThe Dance Pavilion from 1891 show a festival of social awkwardness, a summer\u2019s evening dance, with its curious mixture of participants. The backgrounds of each are revealed by the style of their clothes: young women from the country still wear dull-coloured shawls and aprons, while the more sophisticated wear fashionable dresses and exuberant hats.\nIn the left background is a carriage and pair of horses driving past, the coachman wearing a top hat with tails, and his passengers dressed up in their finest.\nErik Henningsen (1855\u20131930), Evicted (1892), oil on canvas, dimensions not known, Statens Museum for Kunst (Den Kongelige Malerisamling), Copenhagen, Denmark. Wikimedia Commons.\nEvicted from 1892 returns to a theme more appropriate to \u2018social realism\u2019, as a family of four is evicted into the street in the winter snow. With them are their meagre possessions, including a saw suggesting the father may be a carpenter. In the background he is still arguing with a policeman.\nErik Henningsen (1855\u20131930), An Injured Worker (1895), oil on canvas, 131.5 x 187 cm, Statens Museum for Kunst (Den Kongelige Malerisamling), Copenhagen, Denmark. Wikimedia Commons.\nIn An Injured Worker (1895), Henningsen tackles another major social issue. The scene is a gravel or sand pit outside a town (in the distance at the right). A worker has been injured there, and is being carried away on a stretcher. By his side is his wife, who is in tears and being comforted by one of her husband\u2019s managers. Behind and to the left are a policeman, and a doctor who wears a top hat and is wiping his hands after dressing the man\u2019s wounds.\nErik Henningsen (1855\u20131930), The Nordic Natural Science Research Meeting 14 July 1847 (1895), mural, dimensions not known, Aula, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. Wikimedia Commons.\nHenningsen\u2019s realism was appreciated by institutions such as the University of Copenhagen. In 1895, he completed a mural in the Aula of that university showing a major international event, The Nordic Natural Science Research Meeting 14 July 1847. Presiding was the great Danish physicist and chemist Hans Christian \u00d8rsted, who was nearly seventy at the time.\nErik Henningsen (1855\u20131930), An Agitator (1899), oil on canvas, 120 x 180 cm, Metalskolen J\u00f8rlunde, Frederikssund, Denmark. Wikimedia Commons.\nTowards the end of the nineteenth century, socialism and other radical movements swept across Europe and the Nordic countries. In An Agitator (1899), Henningsen shows one of the many campaigners of the day standing and trying to move the crowd in front of him. Interestingly the audience here appears drawn from across society, and not just from men of the working class.\nMounted police are present to ensure that nothing gets out of hand.\nHenningsen\u2019s poster of The Thirsty Man was his submission in Tuborg\u2019s 1900 competition to celebrate its twenty-fifth anniversary. Surprisingly, it was unsuccessful, and the prize of 10,000 Danish Kroner was awarded elsewhere. However, it was this poster which was actually used to advertise Tuborg\u2019s beers, and which remains in use well over a century later.\nErik Henningsen (1855\u20131930), The Fire (1901), further details not known. Wikimedia Commons.\nHenningsen returned to social issues in this painting of another family set out in the street with their possessions, this time the result of The Fire (1901). As firemen continue to damp down the blaze in a house, in a country town, two children comfort one another on their salvaged bed. Behind them their mother is pointing accusingly at an older, well-dressed man, who appears to be to blame for their predicament.\nBystanders from the rest of the street stand back watching from the other side of the road.\nHenningsen also painted some conventional history paintings, and in the twentieth century apparently turned to genre scenes of the bourgeoisie, but this series of \u2018social realist\u2019 or Naturalist works puts him alongside the likes of Christian Krohg, and the many French artists who followed the lead of Jules Bastien-Lepage in the 1880s and 1890s. Yet I haven\u2019t seen Henningsen or his paintings included in accounts of Naturalism in Europe or the Nordic countries.\nPosted in General, Life, Painting and tagged Bastien-Lepage, Henningsen, Krohg, naturalism, painting, realism.

I\u2019d like to start again on how we approach our defense this year,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI\u2019d like to start that over again. I\u2019m sure everybody else would too.\u201d\nShould Jones move in another direction, a new coordinator would at least inherit talented players in DeMarcus Lawrence, Jaylon Smith, and Leighton Vander Esch.\nHowever, Dallas has a lot of work to do before they can be considered a respectable defense.\nHere are three potential candidates to steer the Cowboys in the right direction.\n1. George Edwards\nShould the Cowboys want to promote within, George Edwards is a name at the top of the list.\nHe was originally hired as the linebackers coach from 1998 to 2001, and after a couple of stops around the league, returned to Dallas this year as a Senior Defensive Assistant.\nEdwards has experience as a defensive coordinator, working in this capacity under Mike Zimmer with the Minnesota Vikings.\nWhile he never called plays, Zimmer\u2019s tutelage could go a long way should Edwards take over the role in Dallas.\nHis familiarity with the players and affinity for running a 4-3 base defense is an advantage he has over other candidates.\nHowever, he has undoubtedly played a role in the Cowboys\u2019 defensive collapse this year.\nPerhaps all he needs is a chance to take over to get them back on track.\n2. Marvin Lewis\nAnother branch from the coaching tree of Mike Zimmer, Marvin Lewis is a coach that could help the Cowboys\u2019 defense reverse course.\nLewis is best known for his inability to grab a postseason win with Cincinnati Bengals in 16 years as the head coach, but that should not be a reason for concern.\nHe is well respected within the league and can bring the credibility necessary to change the defensive culture in Dallas.\nHe also runs a 4-3 base defense that could make his transition much easier with the team.\nLewis last worked in the NFL in 2018 but has since been coaching at the collegiate level at Arizona State.\nIf he is willing to leave his role as the co-defensive coordinator with the Sun Devils, he would be a welcome addition to the Cowboys\u2019 staff.\n3. Wade Phillips\nIf Dallas wanted to take a nostalgic route, they could test the waters with a former coach in Wade Phillips.\nJones fired Phillips as the head coach in 2010, creating a rift between the two parties.\nHowever, they have since mended the relationship, making him an interesting option to take over defensive duties.\nSince his departure, Phillips found success with the Houston Texans, Denver Broncos, and Los Angeles Rams.\nHe is an excellent defensive mind and would quickly command the respect of the defense.\nWhile he does traditionally call a 3-4 base defense, he would more than likely be an improvement over what Dallas currently runs.\nPhillips may not want to coach anymore, let alone for the Cowboys, but Dallas should still give him a call.\nFiled Under: Dallas Cowboys Rumors And News (Updated Daily), NFL Tagged With: Dallas Cowboys\nMore Dallas Cowboys News\nCowboys DC Dan Quinn Makes A Decision For 2023\nColin Cowherd Makes Strong Statement About Mike McCarthy\nMicah Parsons Posts Emotional Message To Dismissed Coaches\nSkip Bayless Has A Dak Prescott Replacement In Mind\nThe Cowboys Remain A World-Class TV Draw\nMichael Gallup Had A 2022 Season To Forget\nCowboys OC Reportedly Getting More Interviews This Cycle\nDak Prescott Vows To Be Better In 2023\nNick Wright Mocks The Cowboys For Shocking Final Play\nNFL Analyst Sums Up Life For Cowboys Fans\nJerry Jones Holds Firm On His HC Decision\nDak Prescott Shared A Promise For The Future\nPhotographer Comments After Mike McCarthy Shoving Incident\nMike McCarthy Is Historically Bad Against The 49ers\nThe Cowboys Remain Stuck In Divisional Round Rut\nSkip Bayless Shares Dramatic Video For Dak Prescott\nSkip Bayless Shares Ultimate Dak Prescott Roast\nCowboys Continue Unfortunate Postseason Streak\n2 Bold Predictions For Cowboys Vs. 49ers\nCeeDee Lamb Must Play A Big Role For The Cowboys Offense On Sunday\nThe Cowboys Have A Roster That Should Be Set For The Future\nMicah Parsons Is Embracing The Underdog Mentality\n2 Keys To The Cowboys Winning On Sunday\nTony Dungy Reveals Why He Thinks The Cowboys Will Lose Sunday"}

{"text": "Rimadyl (carprofen) is a prescription made particularly to treat mutts with osteoarthritis. Much like Previcox, it is a NSAID, and it creates its belongings by restraining cyclooxygenase (COX). The two types of cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2, have distinctive parts in the body \u2013 COX-1 is included with the capacity of the kidneys and platelets, while COX-2 is for the most part required in the provocative reaction. Since COX-1 is critical in the body, and in light of the fact that the principle objective while treating joint pain is to lessen irritation, prescriptions which save COX-1 while repressing COX-2 are favored. Rimadyl is thought to be all the more saving of COX-1 at restorative dosages which implies mutts are less inclined to experience issues with the kidneys, platelets or stomach than with a portion of the more seasoned era cyclooxygenase inhibitors.\nIn spite of the more specific hindrance of COX-2, carprofen still can possibly bring about symptoms, especially in senior pooches, and ought not be given to those with liver or kidney infection. Due to the danger (however uncommon in sound pooches) of awful responses which can prompt passing in the most serious cases, we prescribe attempting common cures and supplements before turning to treatment with this prescription.\nRimadyl is likely more secure for puppies than different NSAIDs like aspirin, and is more saving of COX-1 than numerous different medications of its kind, yet it can bring about terrible responses. These awful responses can be extreme and there are even reports of of dogs dying during treatment.\nCarprofen has additionally been appeared to influence TSH and aggregate T4 levels in the blood. Strangely, free T4 appears to stay unaffected, yet this ought to in any case be thought about when testing thyroid capacity, and alert is prompted.\nTalk to you vet about any adverse effects your dog experiences during treatment. Signs of liver damage include yellow tinting of the eyes or gums, while kidney damage may result in changes to the frequency of urination."}

{"text": "Ice Fishing Tackle Tips To Catch More Crappie\nIce fishing is a time-honored tradition among a certain segment of northern anglers.\nFishermen by the thousands take to the ice each year, and the practice continually evolves in terms of equipment, tackle, and techniques. Veterans follow the trends and regularly upgrade their equipment and accessories to better practice their craft, in much the same way that an open-water angler does each year.\nBut what about the other would-be fishermen out there who have never ventured out on the ice, even those considering a late trip this winter or those planning ahead to the 2021-22 ice-fishing season? What are the basic necessities needed to get started?\nThe list to complete successful \u2013 and comfortable \u2013 trips onto the ice takes some planning, and buying tackle and complementary equipment can be pricey. The average fisherman might already possess a few lures, possibly even some electronics, and suitable clothing that will suffice for ice fishing, but the sport normally involves specialty equipment.\nWe spoke with two members of the ACC pro staff, Wisconsin resident Davis Lenzen and Goose Gutzman, of Minnesota. With years of ice-fishing experience between the two, they provide the details about the necessities for a beginning fisherman.\nLet\u2019s start with tackle, which is generally moderately priced compared to some of the other high-end items needed for ice fishing. As pro staffers, both Davis and Goose tout the quality of the ACC rods, which come in 28-, 30 \u00bd-, and 32-inch lengths. Each of the rods has its strengths. The 28 Ice, for example, excels in the close quarters of an ice shack where space is minimal.\nPair the rod with a regular spinning reel \u2013 Goose said he uses Pflueger or Lew\u2019s Wally Marshall models \u2013 and you\u2019re set. Davis also mentioned the specialty inline reels, like those produced by Piscifun. Davis uses the ICX model, which looks to combine elements of spinning, baitcasting, and fly reels.\nRegardless of the type reel employed, quality line leads to more fishing success. Davis suggested using the specialty ice-fishing mono in 2- or 4-lb. test. The coating on these lines allow ease of use in extreme cold. Goose uses a braid to mono combo, spooling with 4-lb. Suffix 832 braid and adding a 2-foot section of 2- or 3-lb. leader.\nRegardless of the choice, quality rod-reel-line combinations can be found in the $100 range, and 2-3 combos is usually sufficient, especially considering that certain states restrict the number of rods that can be used by individuals.\nWhen choosing lures, Davis said to keep it simple, adding that panfish are a likely starting point for beginners.\n\u201cThis is one thing that many people already have,\u201d Davis said. \u201cYou need your smaller jigs and a smaller fly box, with jigs from about 1/32nd up to about 1/16th.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need a ton of them. Choose a few in basic colors, and put them in a flybox in a pocket of your jacket.\u201d\nMoving from one end of the price spectrum to the other, both Davis and Goose discussed several more expensive items that are now considered necessities for the modern ice fisherman.\n\u201cEverybody needs a good locator,\u201d Goose said.\nLike the electronics found on boats, ice fishermen use a variety of fish finders. Goose uses a Vexilar, one of the popular names in ice-fishing electronics. Davis mentioned Vexilar and Humminbird models.\nBudget models of the Vexilar can be purchased for about $200.00 with some online deals running slightly less. Top-end versions in the series run close to $1,000.00.\nGoose catches plenty of fish, mainly \u201csunnies\u201d (bream) and crappie, with a Vexilar 20 model flasher although he says he likes to accompany friends with LiveScope technology, which appears to work as equally well under the ice as it does in open water.\nDavis, see his Flopping Crappie videos on YouTube, continues to refine his LiveScope game and said an option is to convert boat electronics to a functional ice-fishing unit.\n\u201cIf you do convert, what\u2019s really nice is having your GPS mapping system that shows the lake contours and more detailed stuff like that,\u201d he said.\nAn equally important tool to consider for ice fishing is an auger. Traditional manual augers can still be had for about $100.00 and up.\n\u201cNils makes a nice one that goes through the ice really well,\u201d Goose said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not prepared to spend a lot of money, it\u2019s something to consider. You\u2019ve got to have one. You can at least get through the ice.\u201d\nBoth Davis and Goose, however, said modern technology has truly changed ice fishing. Electric augers with lightweight lithium batteries are readily available and can handle just about any depth of ice. Gas augers can still be purchased and are useful when ice gets its thickest, but the need for gas power is waning as electric models evolve.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna cost a little money if you want to go lightweight,\u201d Goose said. \u201cThe Milwaukee Fuel with the pistol bit by Eskimo is a good choice. The Strikemaster lithium 24-volt is a pretty nice unit for $400 bucks.\n\u201cYou can probably get 30 holes in 2 feet of ice out of it. You can buy an extra battery for about $100, so that gives you about 60 holes in a day.\u201d\nAdded Davis, \u201cThe beauty of power augers these days is that a lot of guys just buy a Milwaukee M18 drill with adapter for the auger bit. That\u2019s what I use.\u201d\nWith tackle, electronics, and auger in hand, beginning ice fishermen are almost ready to go. What\u2019s next?\nFor Goose, it\u2019s comfortable clothing and footware.\n\u201cYou definitely want warm clothes and boots,\u201d said Goose, who rarely fishes from an ice house but chooses to brave the coldest of weather outside. \u201cDon\u2019t skimp on your boots if you can afford not to. I wear boots called Inferno by Cabela\u2019s. My feet don\u2019t get cold even when I\u2019m on the ice all day.\u201d\nConcerning outer wear, which ranges from $200.00 at the low end up to about $800.00, Goose mentioned bibs and jackets by Clam and Striker. Davis stays warm in Norfin Element gear, which is affordable but also comes equipped with flotation technology and other advanced features often associated with more expensive brands.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the great things about the Element suit and is probably something that open-water fishermen who are out there regularly in the coldest weather should consider,\u201d Davis said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a life jacket.\u201d\nA sled is another specialty item used by both Davis and Goose. Otter models, typically about 2 \u00bd feet wide and up to 5 feet long, work well for both anglers. Whether pulled by the fishermen or by an ATV, the sled needs to be large enough to carry equipment.\n\u201cI\u2019m able to fit my ice shack, chair, heater, minnow bucket, ice rods and tackle, fish finder and tow it all around,\u201d Davis said.\nAn ice shack, also referred to as a shanty or house, is another consideration, especially when northern winter days or nights are at their coldest.\nWhile Goose said he prefers the mobility of open-air fishing, Davis typically chooses to fish inside as the season progresses.\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s getting down to zero or below in December and later in the year, then I\u2019ve probably going to use some type of shack,\u201d he said.\nEnclosures run the gamut of prices and features with some as simple as a sled (some with fixed seating) that coverts to a shack to other structures so large that they have to be towed onto the ice.\nDavis typically has a small heater like the Mr. Heater Little Buddy propane model available in extreme cold. The Mr. Heater line is affordable, and most models come equipped with safety features (like oxygen sensors) associated with using gas heaters indoors.\nGoose said safety is always an issue on the ice, and that idea applies to using a heater in an enclosed space.\n\u201cI don\u2019t use a heater,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they can be dangerous if not used correctly, but a lot of people use them.\u201d\nAside from the comfort afforded by quality clothing, shelters, and heaters, other accessories also make for more comfortable time spent on the ice. Some of them are likely items that the beginner would never consider.\n\u201cI can think of a couple of other things that make ice fishing easier,\u201d Davis said. \u201cA good (ice) skimmer is really nice to have. To get as compact as possible, many people are using plastic minnow scoopers as skimmers. You can use your hand, but after a while, it\u2019s going to get really cold.\n\u201cAnother thing that makes ice fishing easier is an ice cleat thrown over your boots. They are especially useful before there is much snow cover. A cleat makes walking on the ice a lot easier, especially if you\u2019re pulling a sled.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve covered the basics. Some items are easy to find at an affordable price. Others require a financial commitment. Goose regularly pointed to the cost of items and said purchasing everything at once may not be an option.\n\u201cIt may take time to build up your arsenal,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might have to do it over a period of time because everything costs money. That may mean buying one expensive item one year and something else the next.\u201d\nDavis also said that fishermen can overwhelm themselves with gear, tackle and accessories, emphasizing the \u201cless-is-more\u201d philosophy can still lead to fishing success.\nWith the basics in hand, ice-fishing is still an option at least for a short time this year. If not intended for immediate use, then slowly acquire the gear needed to enjoy a new experience in the outdoors. Make a list and check it off as you acquire each item. Veteran ice fishermen suggest it will be worth every penny."}

With their origins in the worlds of vaudeville and jazz music, they enjoyed great commercial success throughout the decade, selling a considerable number of records and packing out clubs and theatres alike. Never has there been another time when women so dominated the genre and made the blues so much their own.\nMamie Smith was the first to emerge from the vaudeville circuit and became the first African-American artist to make a blues recording in 1920 with the featured \u2018Crazy Blues\u2019. The immense success of this recording opened the door for many others to follow such as Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, Sippie Wallace and Ida Cox.\nMa Rainey and Bessie Smith were undoubtedly the most captivating and expressive of what became known as the \u2018classic blues\u2019 singers. Both dressed in flamboyant style and their powerful voices and forceful personalities set the standard for recorded blues, selling well among a southern rural audience familiar with their travelling tent shows and musical revues. Drawing upon some of the finest jazz talent of the early and mid-1920s for studio accompaniment, the classic blues of Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey and other popular blues singers was always full of double entendre or hidden and multiple meanings. Although an outcrop of Southern rural blues, an expression of the poor and oppressed, the sequined glamour of the classic blues was seen as a welcome contrast to drab lives. So while the blues until the 1920s was largely local, rural, Southern and male, these women were urban performance artists, travelling and performing in the new speakeasies and nightclubs of a dynamic era.\nThe classic blues had a great impact also on important rural bluesmen, and here both Kate McTell and Bertha Lee are accompanied by their illustrious bluesmen husbands Messrs Blind Willie McTell and Charley Patton. Likewise, Blind Blake provides typically nimble and ingenious accompaniment for Irene Scruggs \u2013 commonly known as \u2018Chocolate Brown\u2019 \u2013 on \u2018Itching Heel\u2019 which demonstrates sublime interplay between the two. These vintage tracks highlight the significant role that women have played in the more rural aspects of early blues, which is further demonstrated by the haunting voice of Lottie Kimbrough whose self-penned song \u2018Rolling Log Blues\u2019 has subsequently been recorded by many important blues performers.\nDuring the 1930s, blues music underwent a radical change as larger-than-life female singers fell out of favour with the public and male guitarists like Blind Lemon Jefferson, Charley Patton and Tampa Red started to capture people\u2019s imagination. Memphis Minnie, though, transcended this change in the public's musical tastes, as her powerful vocals commanded authority and her six-string skills rivalled and, in many cases, surpassed those of her male contemporaries. Mattie Delaney was another accomplished guitarist whose variant of Tommy Johnson\u2019s \u2018Big Road Blues\u2019 shows how she possessed one of the most remarkable voices in country blues. Geeshie Wiley is widely considered to be one of the greatest ever recorded country blues singers whose style is totally unconventional. Here she teams up with her female compatriot Evie Thomas for a wonderful rendition of \u2018Pick Poor Robin Clean\u2019.\nWhen the Depression effectively ended the careers of many of the classic blues artists including Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith, the blues revivalists were ultimately looking for an \"authenticity\" that they equated with the country blues, particularly that of the Mississippi Delta region, so many of the blues queens of the 1930s were largely forgotten. This welcome collection deservedly revives the memory of both the urban and rural female blues singers who played a pivotal role in the development of the blues.\nCollections: Albums, Best Sellers, Blues, CD Releases, Digital Releases, Jazz & Blues, Legends, North America, Subscription Products, Vinyl Releases\nThe Rough Guide To African Guitar\nThe Rough Guide To African Guitar Various\nThe Rough Guide To Brazilian Psychedelia\nThe Rough Guide To Brazilian Psychedelia Various\nThe Rough Guide To Chicago Blues\nThe Rough Guide To Chicago Blues Various\nThe Rough Guide To Urban Mali\nThe Rough Guide To Urban Mali Various\nThe Rough Guide To Spiritual India\nThe Rough Guide To Spiritual India Various\nRough Guide To Robert Johnson - Delta Blues Legend\nRough Guide To Robert Johnson - Delta Blues Legend Robert Johnson"}

{"text": "What Happens After Cruises\nSamples collected by scientists aboard Nautilus are available to researchers around the world.\nOnce an expedition ends, the collection of data and specimens live on in the laboratories of researchers, the archives of data centers, and the repositories of institutions. Although researchers on board and ashore sometimes recognize an exciting new discovery immediately, most discoveries will occur long after explorers return from sea. In addition, most deep-sea locations are unlikely to be revisited, further increasing the value of the data and specimens since they may remain the only information about a particular location for decades to come. As such, Ocean Exploration Trust (OET) preserves the priceless data, video, and samples gathered on expeditions in accordance with the highest standards to ensure it will be useful for decades to come.\nROV Data & Video\nScientists involved in the expedition, either on ship or shore, will continue to work on a portion of the data and samples, but there are many more discoveries to be made. As such, the video, data, and samples that result from our expeditions are available to any interested researcher immediately by request. Full datasets are sent to the Rolling Deck to Repository facility for long-term archival, visibility to researchers, and accessibility. Inclusion in well-known archives is critical as it is likely that researchers years from now will make discoveries from the standard datasets we collect on our expeditions. Starting in 2019, additional access to the satellite recordings of the ROV dives can be found on our Dive Recordings YouTube channel.\nMoving Samples from Ship to Shore\nSo little is known about the inhabitants of the deep-sea that discoveries of new species or range extensions of organisms are quite common. Whole specimens and tissue sub-samples for DNA analysis have been housed at Harvard University\u2019s Museum of Comparative Zoology since 2013.

Mapping data is also contributed to global bathymetry archives such as the GEBCO project, Seabed 2030, which aims to produce a complete map of the seafloor by 2030.

It can take months for a researcher to recognize that a specimen is a new species and many years to formally write and publish a species description. Similarly, scientific work requires months to years of analysis, synthesis, and reduction to culminate in a publication. In order to raise awareness of the initial results of our cruises in a more timely way, OET works with expedition teams to write cruise summaries that are published annually in the Oceanography Society Magazine supplement: New Frontiers in Ocean Exploration. This is a great place to gain more information about our annual field programs. We continue to curate a growing list of manuscripts, books and book chapters, theses, and dissertations from the data and samples collected aboard Nautilus. We are proud of the time, care, and effort researchers put into ensuring exploration furthers our understanding of the planet. These discoveries can build momentum, leading to exciting avenues of research or the development of technologies to improve exploration capabilities.\nParticipate live as we explore through our Scientist Ashore Program via telepresence, and request data and samples.\nGet a sneak peek of where we're headed next or revisit the discoveries of our past expeditions.\nExplore the list of manuscripts, books and book chapters, theses, and dissertations from the data and samples collected aboard Nautilus."}
{"text": "Keeping an Eye on Vendor Risk\nEdward Amoroso | May 01, 2017\nAsk any enterprise security risk manager about their favorite PowerPoint chart, and I know the answer: It\u2019ll be the one showing aggregate risk for each executive group on a named basis. You know the chart: It\u2019s that one with that histogram showing Operations under Ms. Crosby with 39 high risk items, Marketing under Mr. Stills having 23 high-risk items, Engineering under Ms. Nash having 11 high-risk items, and so on.\nEveryone pays attention when this shame chart is up on the screen because it names names. It connects risk to the people who make decisions about security. And nowhere is the risk more intense than with the vendors, suppliers, and other third-parties supporting an organization. These external groups are usually the primary root cause behind your bad risk score on that uncomfortable histogram.\nLast week, I had the great privilege to visit the headquarters of Prevalent, a New Jersey-based cyber security firm offering continuous monitoring and management of third-party risk. I couldn\u2019t contain my enthusiasm when CEO Jonathan Dambrot and his team showed me their fine dashboards and series of risk reports. All I could think of was how such fine-grained reporting would be so useful for enterprise security teams.\nThe basis for the Prevalent offering is the obvious need for continuous risk monitoring of third-party organizations to properly manage enterprise cyber security. \u201cThe major factors determining third-party risk,\u201d Dambrot explained, \u201cinclude the service they provide, the sensitivity of their work, the type and scope of access they\u2019ve been given, and many similar factors \u2013 including business and financial viability.\u201d\nUsing these factors, the Prevalent platform continually maintains an accurate risk scoring for each third-party engagement, thus reducing dependence on conventional, manual risk assessments. The problem, as Dambrot explained, is that \u201cthe way expert security assessments are done today results in a risk snapshot for a specific time, without any continuous view of how factors might change after an assessment.\u201d\nThis automation of the tedious security assessment process may be one of the most consequential aspects of any risk management platform. Periodic scheduled reviews of security are error-prone and limited by the expertise of the reviewer. \u201cScaling and automating the laborious, expensive assessment process is a huge pain point with heavy cost and consistency burdens,\u201d explained Prevalent executive Dave McNamara. \u201cSolving that and the continuous threat view is where the magic happens.\u201d\nBut here is where it gets interesting: The company offers a collaboration capability called Synapse, which allows for uniform, automated sharing of third-party risk data. This is not some chatty \u201cYelp for vendors,\u201d but is rather a mechanized information exchange using standard, structured reporting to support comparative baselining of risk \u2013 not just within the company, but across different organizations. This is a powerful capability, one that should be a norm in all enterprise risk environments.\nThe Prevalent team was kind enough to share a demonstration of their platform portal, which includes all the drill-down and highlighting capabilities one would expect in an automated tool for risk managers. We discussed the possibility of adding a more visually striking SOC-mode view, but that is a nice-to-have rather than a requirement. The platform certainly appears to do its job, and I suspect that risk managers will like the features.\nTo summarize: The use of shame charts illustrates the conundrum of enterprise risk management \u2013 namely, that managers do care about risk scores, despite practical evidence to the contrary. Third-party engagements are the riskiest aspect of any business, which is why the Prevalent platform is compelling: It combines continuous assessment, well-designed portal features, and accurate risk scoring into a platform that keeps an eye on third-party vendor risk."}

To regulate activation and maintain homeostasis, macrophages have multiple intrinsic mechanisms, one of which is modulation through autophagy. Here we demonstrate that autophagy induction by rapamycin suppressed the production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 in lipopolysaccharide- and adenosine triphosphate-activated macrophages at the post-transcriptional level by eliminating mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) and pro-IL1\u03b2 in a p62/SQSTM1-dependent manner. In addition, rapamycin activated Nrf2 through up-regulation of p62/SQSTM1, which further contributed to the reduction of mtROS. Reduced IL-1\u03b2 subsequently diminished the activation of p38 MAPK-NF\u03baB pathways, leading to transcriptional down-regulation of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and I\u03baB\u03b1 in rapamycin-treated macrophages. Therefore, our results suggest that rapamycin negatively regulates macrophage activation by restricting a feedback loop of NLRP3 inflammasome-p38 MAPK-NF\u03baB pathways in autophagy- and p62/SQSTM1-dependent manners.\nRapamycin regulates macrophage activation by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome-p38 MAPK-NF\u03baB pathways in autophagy- and p62-dependent manners | Ko | Oncotarget\nMacrophages are critical effectors of inflammation and the innate immune response. Upon tissue injury or infection, macrophages detect a wide range of endogenous and exogenous \u2018danger\u2019 signals and elicit the inflammatory process to protect the tissue [1, 2]. However, excessive or prolonged activation of macrophages leads to disease by causing collateral tissue damage and chronic para-inflammation [3]. Therefore, tight control of macrophage activation is pivotal to avoid tissue dysfunction and maintain homeostasis [4]. Indeed, there are multiple intrinsic mechanisms in macrophages to regulate activation, one of which is modulation by autophagy [5\u20137].\nAutophagy is a ubiquitous eukaryotic process that enables cells to digest their cytoplasmic contents in lysosomes. Basal autophagy is necessary for cellular \u201chousekeeping\u201d to eliminate damaged organelles such as depolarized mitochondria through mitophagy [8\u201310]. Also, autophagy can be induced to preserve cellular homeostasis under diverse conditions of metabolic, physical, infectious, or immunologic stress [11, 12].\nNLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex in myeloid cells including macrophages that mediates the cleavage of caspase-1, leading to the maturation and secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 [13]. Recently, studies have elucidated the role of autophagy in macrophage regulation through its effects on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Blockade of autophagy enhanced IL-1\u03b2 production in macrophages [14], whereas activation of autophagy inhibits IL-1\u03b2 secretion by targeting ubiquitinated inflammasomes or pro-IL-1\u03b2 for lysosomal degradation [14, 15]. Also, autophagy induction by inflammatory signals limits NLRP3 inflammasome activation by removing damaged mitochondria and preventing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) release [9, 10, 16, 17]. Furthermore, macrophages deficient in autophagic proteins ATG16L1, LC3B, or beclin 1 produce high levels of IL-1\u03b2 and cleaved caspase 1 following stimulation by NLRP3 inflammasome activators [10, 18].\nRapamycin is the prototypical inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and inhibits mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). The mTORC1 actively suppresses autophagy by phosphorylating ULK1 [6]. Therefore, rapamycin is a strong inducer of autophagy. In addition to autophagy modulation, mTORC1 signaling pathway regulates a variety of intracellular processes in innate immune cells through multiple mechanisms involving metabolism, protein translation, cytokine production, antigen presentation, macrophage polarization, or cell migration [6]. Given these complex functions of mTORC1, mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin can be pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory depending on the cell types and environmental or cellular stress.\nIn this study, we investigated the effects of rapamycin on macrophages that were activated to trigger NLRP3 inflammasome. We demonstrate that autophagy induction by rapamycin inhibits IL-1\u03b2 secretion in macrophages at the post-transcriptional level by reducing mtROS and pro-IL-1\u03b2. Moreover, rapamycin induces p62/SQSTM1 and Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid-derived-2-like 2) in an autophagy-independent manner, which helps further suppress mtROS and NLRP3 inflammasome. Diminished extracellular IL-1\u03b2 subsequently reduces the transcriptional activity of IL1\u03b2-p38 MAP kinase (MAPK)-NF\u03baB pathways. These results collectively suggest that rapamycin negatively regulates macrophage activation by augmenting autophagy and inhibiting a positive feedback loop of NLRP3 inflammasome-p38 MAPK-NF\u03baB pathways.\nRapamycin inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation through autophagy induction\nWe first examined whether rapamycin inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. To address this question, we adopted an established in vitro model of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, in which adenosine triphosphate (ATP) drives cleavage of caspase-1 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed macrophages [9, 19\u201321]. Macrophages differentiated from THP-1 cells were treated with LPS and then stimulated with ATP in the presence of various concentrations of rapamycin. As expected, the cleaved caspase-1 and secreted IL-1\u03b2 were markedly increased in macrophages stimulated with LPS/ATP as assayed by Western blot and ELISA, confirming the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome (Figure 1A, 1B). Rapamycin treatment significantly suppressed IL-1\u03b2 secretion and caspase-1 cleavage in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1A, 1B). The level of pro-caspase-1 was not reduced by rapamycin (Supplementary Figure 1). To rule out the possibility that the reduction in IL-1\u03b2 secretion and cleaved caspase-1 resulted indirectly from the cytotoxicity of rapamycin on macrophages, the cell viability was assessed after rapamycin treatment. Rapamycin did not exhibit any cytotoxic effects on the cells as measured by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay (Figure 1C). Hence, low but effective concentration (50 nM) of rapamycin was used in subsequent experiments.\nFigure 1: Rapamycin inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation through autophagy induction. THP-1-differentiated macrophages were stimulated by LPS (2 \u03bcg/mL, 4 h), followed by ATP (5 mM, 45 min) in the presence of rapamycin (Rapa, 0 to 100 nM). After 18 h of culture, the cells and supernatants were analyzed. (A, B) The IL-1\u03b2 secretion was quantified in supernatants by ELISA, and the level of cleaved caspase-1 measured in cell lysates by Western blot. (C) The cell viability was analyzed by MTT assay. (D) Representative images of Western blot analysis for LC3, p62/SQSTM1, beclin 1 (BECN1), and ATG5 in cell lysates from LPS/ATP-stimulated macrophages \u00b1 Rapa in the presence or absence of bafilomycin A1 (BafA1, 75 nM).

(I) Representative images of Western blot analysis for LC3, BECN1, and ATG5 in cell lysates from LPS/ATP-stimulated macrophages in the presence or absence of 3-methyl adenine (3MA, 2.5 mM). (J) ELISA analysis of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 from supernatants of LPS/ATP-stimulated macrophages in the presence of either 3MA (2.5 mM) or BafA1 (75 nM). (K) ELISA analysis of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 from supernatants of LPS/ATP-stimulated macrophages \u00b1 Rapa (50 nM) in the presence of either 3MA (2.5 mM) or BafA1 (75 nM). Data are representative of more than four independent experiments (Mean + SD). Significance was determined by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s HSD test. ns: not significant, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.\nNext, we evaluated whether the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome by rapamycin is mediated through autophagy induction. Western blot analysis revealed that the levels of autophagic proteins (LC3-II, beclin 1, and ATG5) were increased in macrophages after stimulation with LPS/ATP (Figure 1D\u20131G), consistent with previous reports that upon inflammasome stimulation, autophagy is activated in macrophages as a regulatory mechanism [14, 17]. Rapamycin treatment further increased the levels of LC3-II, beclin 1, and ATG5 (Figure 1D\u20131G). Additionally, rapamycin caused a decrease in the autophagy adaptor p62/SQSTM1 protein in cultures without bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) and accumulation of p62/SQSTM1 in cultures with BafA1 (Figure 1D, 1H). BafA1 blocks the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes, and thereby inhibits degradation of proteins including LC3-II and p62/SQSTM1 [22]. Therefore, these results collectively indicate that rapamycin further enhanced autophagy in LPS/ATP-treated macrophages.\nTo clarify the role of autophagy in suppression of inflammasome, 3-methyl adenine (3-MA) that blocks autophagosome formation [23] was added to the culture. As expected, 3-MA decreased the levels of autophagic proteins in macrophages (Figure 1I). Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA increased IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 secretion in LPS/ATP-treated macrophages, demonstrating the up-regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Figure 1J). Importantly, 3-MA reversed the effects of rapamycin in suppressing IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 secretion that was significantly increased in LPS/ATP-treated macrophages as a consequence of NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Figure 1K). In addition, when autophagy was suppressed by BafA1 that inhibits the late-phase autophagy [22], similar results were observed (Figure 1J, 1K).\nTherefore, the data suggest that autophagy serves as a cell-intrinsic mechanism to limit NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and rapamycin potentiates this regulatory mechanism by inducing autophagy.\nAutophagy induction by rapamycin reduces mitochondrial ROS and pro-IL1\u03b2\nWe next investigated how rapamycin-induced autophagy negatively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. A common upstream signal for the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is oxidative stress, which generates ROS from dysregulated mitochondria [9, 20, 21]. Cells eliminate defective mitochondria using a specialized form of autophagy, called mitophagy [24]. Therefore, we hypothesized that autophagy induction by rapamycin inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation through reduction of mtROS. To measure mtROS, the cells were co-stained with CellROX dye that fluoresces upon oxidation by ROS and Mitotracker (MT) Green dye that stains total mitochondria regardless of mitochondrial membrane potential [25]. The level of mtROS, as measured by flow cytometry for CellROX+MT Green+ cells, was increased in macrophages upon LPS/ATP stimulation (Figure 2A, 2B). Rapamycin significantly reduced the level of mtROS (Figure 2A, 2B). On the contrary, treatment of macrophages with autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA or BafA1, markedly increased the mtROS level (Figure 2A, 2B). Of note, the addition of 3-MA or BafA1 to rapamycin-treated cultures negated the effects of rapamycin in suppressing mtROS in macrophages, indicating that the action of rapamycin was dependent on autophagy (Figure 2A, 2B).\nFigure 2: Rapamycin reduces mitochondrial ROS and pro-IL1\u03b2, but does not change mRNA levels of NLRP3 and IL-1\u03b2. Differentiated THP-1 cells were stimulated by LPS (2 \u03bcg/mL, 4 h), followed by ATP (5 mM, 45 min) in the presence or absence of rapamycin (Rapa, 50 nM). At 2 h after ATP stimulation, the cells were evaluated for gene transcription or mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). 18 h later, the cell lysates were analyzed for pro-IL-1\u03b2 protein. 3-methyl adenine (3MA, 2.5 mM) or bafilomycin A1 (BafA1, 75 nM) was added to some cultures to block early or late phase autophagy. (A, B) The level of mtROS was measured by flow cytometry as % of cells that were stained with both CellROX dye and MitoTracker (MT) Green dye and represented as % CellROX+MT Green+ cells. Shown are representative and quantitative flow cytometry results from three separate experiments. (C) Representative images and densitometric analysis of Western blotting for pro-IL-1\u03b2 in cell lysates. (D) The mRNA levels of NLRP3 and IL-1\u03b2 were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. The fold changes relative to unstimulated macrophages were calculated by the 2-\u0394\u0394CT method. (E) Graphic summary of rapamycin-mediated suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Data are representative of three independent experiments (Mean + SD). Significance was determined by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s HSD test. ns: not significant, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.\nA recent report showed that pro-IL-1\u03b2 can be targeted for autophagic degradation [15]. To address this possibility, we quantified pro-IL-1\u03b2 in lysates of macrophages stimulated with LPS/ATP in the presence of rapamycin by Western blot. Correlated with the results obtained for secreted IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 1A), rapamycin treatment dose-dependently decreased the level of pro-IL-1\u03b2 in macrophages, and blockade of autophagy with 3-MA abolished the rapamycin effect on the pro-IL-1\u03b2 level (Figure 2C). These findings indicate that rapamycin treatment results in autophagic degradation of pro-IL-1\u03b2, which leads to a reduction in secreted IL-1\u03b2.\nWe further checked whether rapamycin contributes to the decrease in IL-1\u03b2 at the transcriptional level. Rapamycin treatment did not alter the mRNA levels of either IL-1\u03b2 or NLRP3 as measured by real-time RT-PCR (Figure 2D), implying that rapamycin suppressed the production of mature IL-1\u03b2 at the post-transcriptional level.\nCollectively, these results suggest that autophagy induction by rapamycin inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages post-transcriptionally by reducing mtROS and pro-IL1\u03b2 (Figure 2E).\np62/SQSTM1 is essential for autophagy induction and NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition by rapamycin\nSince recent studies showed that ablation of the autophagy adaptor p62/SQSTM1 prevents mitophagy [26] and enhances NLRP3-inflammasome activation [27], we examined whether p62/SQSTM1 is involved in the observed effects of rapamycin. To address this, p62/SQSTM1 was knocked down in macrophages by transfecting siRNA (Supplementary Figure 2), and then stimulated the cells with LPS/ATP in the presence of rapamycin. The knockdown of p62/SQSTM1 completely abrogated the effects of rapamycin on macrophages. Rapamycin did not either enhance autophagy or suppress IL-1\u03b2 secretion in macrophages with the knockdown of p62/SQSTM1 (Figure 3A, 3B). Similarly, rapamycin was not effective in reducing the mtROS level in macrophages with p62/SQSTM1 knockdown (Figure 3C), supporting the role of p62/SQSTM1 in mitophagy as previously reported [26]. Taken together, data demonstrate that p62/SQSTM1 plays a critical role in mediating the effects of rapamycin on macrophages.\nFigure 3: Rapamycin upregulates p62/SQSTM1 and Nrf 2 that are critical for mtROS and NLRP3 inflammasome suppression. (A\u2013C) THP-1-differentiated macrophages were transfected with p62/SQSTM1 (p62 KD THP-1) or control scrambled siRNA (SCR KD THP-1) and stimulated by LPS (2 \u03bcg/mL, 4 h) and ATP (5 mM, 45 min) with or without rapamycin (Rapa, 50 nM). The knockdown efficiency of p62/SQSTM1 was confirmed to be 93 \u00b1 0.6% compared to SCR KD THP-1 as assessed by Western blotting and real-time RT-PCR (See Supplementary Figure 2). The protein levels of LC3 and Nrf2 were analyzed by Western blotting in lysates of the cells, and the level of secreted IL-1\u03b2 was measured by ELISA in the supernatants at 18 h of culture.

In line with these studies, we observed that the protein level of p62/SQSTM1 was increased by rapamycin in LPS/ATP-stimulated macrophages when assayed in the presence of BafA1 (Figure 1D, 1H). To further investigate the effects of rapamycin on p62/SQSTM1 expression, we performed the time-course study to measure the protein and mRNA levels of p62/SQSTM1 in macrophages following LPS/ATP stimulation with or without rapamycin. To exclude the effect of autophagic degradation of p62/SQSTM1 on the protein measurements, BafA1 was added to the cultures to block p62/SQSTM1 degradation at the lysosome level [22]. Over 18 h following LPS/ATP treatment, both protein and mRNA levels of p62/SQSTM1 gradually increased in macrophages (Figure 3D, 3E). During the first 1 h, the protein levels of p62/SQSTM1 were lower in the rapamycin-treated cells compared to the cells without rapamycin (Figure 3D, 3E). However, from 4 h to 18 h of rapamycin treatment, the levels of p62/SQSTM1 protein were significantly increased by rapamycin treatment (Figure 3D, 3E). The mRNA levels of p62/SQSTM1 were consistently elevated by rapamycin during 18 h of culture (Figure 3E). The increases of p62/SQSTM1 protein and mRNA in rapamycin-treated macrophages were still observed with an addition of 3-MA, showing that the activity of rapamycin in up-regulating p62/SQSTM1 was independent of autophagy (Figure 3D, 3F).\np62/SQSTM1-dependent Nrf2 activation mediates rapamycin activity in suppressing mtROS\nRecent evidence has revealed that p62/SQSTM1 is at the interface linking autophagy and oxidative stress signaling [30, 31]. As an autophagy adaptor, p62/SQSTM1 binds to ubiquitinated protein aggregates and delivers them to the autophagosome, promoting selective autophagy. In addition, p62/SQSTM1 has recently emerged as a regulator of Nrf2-Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1)-ARE (antioxidant response element) axis by competing with the interaction between Nrf2 and Keap1 and activating the transcription factor Nrf2 whose target genes include antioxidant proteins and detoxification enzymes [32\u201334]. Since we found that rapamycin increased p62/SQSTM1 (Figure 3D\u20133F), we postulated that rapamycin might facilitate Nrf2 activation. Indeed, rapamycin increased the level of Nrf2 and Nrf2 target gene NQO1 in macrophages regardless of the addition of 3-MA (Figure 3G, 3H). We next examined whether the increase in Nrf2 might be caused by increased expression of p62/SQSTM1. The level of Nrf2 protein was not elevated by rapamycin in macrophages with p62/SQSTM1 knockdown (Figure 3A). As it was reported that Nrf2 induces p62/SQSTM1 transcription upon oxidative stress [35], we also checked whether rapamycin upregulates p62/SQSTM1 through Nrf2 activation. Rapamycin was still effective in increasing both mRNA and protein levels of p62/SQSTM1 in macrophages with Nrf2 knockdown (Figure 3I, 3J, Supplementary Figure 2). These data indicate that rapamycin activates Nrf2 in a p62/SQSTM1-dependent manner, but Nrf2 is not responsible for p62/SQSTM1 up-regulation by rapamycin.\nWe further investigated the effect of Nrf2 on oxidative stress induced by LPS/ATP in macrophages. Remarkably, mtROS levels were unchanged by rapamycin in the cells with Nrf2 knockdown, while mtROS was significantly reduced by rapamycin in control cells (Figure 3K). These findings suggest that Nrf2 at least partly mediates the action of rapamycin in suppressing mtROS in macrophages which were activated to trigger NLRP3 inflammasome.\nAutophagy induction by rapamycin inhibits IL1\u03b2-p38 MAPK-NF\u03baB pathway\nIt is well-known that the production of IL-1\u03b2 by macrophages is essential for initiating and driving inflammatory responses upon tissue injury [36]. Since we found above that rapamycin substantially suppresses IL-1\u03b2 secretion in macrophages, we further sought to investigate the impact of rapamycin on IL-1\u03b2-dependent inflammation. First, we examined how rapamycin affects the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes that are induced in macrophages in response to LPS. As expected, the mRNA levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), and I\u03baB\u03b1 were all elevated in macrophages following LPS/ATP stimulation (Figure 2D, Figure 4A, 4B, Supplementary Figure 3). Rapamycin treatment did not alter the mRNA levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 (Figure 2D, Supplementary Figure 3), but markedly reduced the levels of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and I\u03baB\u03b1 transcripts (Figure 4A, 4B, Supplementary Figure 3). Consistent with the mRNA level, rapamycin significantly decreased the secretion of IL-6 (Figure 4A), and the addition of 3-MA reversed the rapamycin effect on IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and I\u03baB\u03b1 (Figure 4A, 4B). However, rapamycin did not affect the secretion of other inflammation-related cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12, or IL-13 in LPS/ATP-treated macrophages (Supplementary Figure 4).\nFigure 4: Rapamycin suppresses transcription of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and I\u03baB\u03b1. Differentiated THP-1 cells were stimulated by LPS (2 \u03bcg/mL, 4 h), followed by ATP (5 mM, 45 min) in the presence or absence of rapamycin (Rapa, 50 nM). At 2 h after ATP stimulation, the cells were evaluated for gene transcription, and at 18 h, the supernatants were analyzed for IL-6 protein. (A, B) The real-time RT-PCR analysis for IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and I\u03baB\u03b1 gene transcription in cell lysates and ELISA analysis for IL-6 protein level in the cell supernatants in the presence or absence of Rapa or 3-methyl adenine (3-MA, 2.5 mM). (C) The mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and I\u03baB were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR in LPS/ATP-stimulated cells with addition of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra, 0 to 100 ng/mL). (D) The mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-8, and I\u03baB\u03b1 were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR in LPS/ATP-stimulated macrophages \u00b1 Rapa with the addition of recombinant human IL-1\u03b2 at various concentrations (0 to 1000 pg/mL). Data are representative of three independent experiments and presented as the fold changes relative to unstimulated macrophages (Mean + SD). Significance was determined by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s HSD test. ns: not significant, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.\nIL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and I\u03baB\u03b1 are canonical IL-1 target genes that are induced in response to binding of IL-1 to IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) [37]. Thus we hypothesized that rapamycin inhibits the levels of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and I\u03baB\u03b1 in macrophages by reducing IL-1\u03b2 secretion. In order to check whether extracellular IL-1\u03b2 is responsible for up-regulation of IL-6 in LPS/ATP-stimulated macrophages, we incubated the cells with IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) at various concentrations. The addition of IL-1ra decreased the transcript levels of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and I\u03baB\u03b1 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C), indicating that secreted IL-1\u03b2 following NLRP3 inflammasome activation stimulates the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines in LPS/ATP-treated macrophages. Moreover, the addition of recombinant IL-1\u03b2 dose-dependently increased the transcription of IL-6, IL-8, and I\u03baB\u03b1 in the rapamycin-treated cells (Figure 4D). Taken together, these data suggest that rapamycin down-regulates the transcription of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and I\u03baB\u03b1 in LPS/ATP-stimulated macrophages through autophagy-dependent suppression of IL-1\u03b2 secretion.\nThe NF-\u03baB signaling and p38 MAPK pathways are activated upon IL-1/IL-1R binding and cooperatively induce the expression of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and I\u03baB\u03b1 [37]. Also, it was previously shown that a positive feedback loop of IL-1 and NF-\u03baB promotes the production of IL-6 in skeletal muscle cells or senescent fibroblasts [38, 39]. Based on this knowledge, we explored the possibility that rapamycin down-regulates the expression of IL-1-inducible genes in macrophages via the p38 MAPK and NF\u03baB signaling. The protein level of phospho-p38 MAPK (pp38) was elevated in macrophages following LPS/ATP stimulation, indicating the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway (Figure 5A). Rapamycin treatment significantly reduced the pp38 level, and the addition of 3-MA abrogated the effect of rapamycin (Figure 5A). Also, inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway with the specific p38 inhibitor SB-208350 significantly reduced the mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 in LPS/ATP-stimulated macrophages, implying that the IL-1\u03b2-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines was dependent on the p38 MAPK signaling pathway (Figure 5B). In addition, rapamycin decreased the translocation of NF-\u03baB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in LPS/ATP-stimulated macrophages as assayed by immunocytochemistry (Figure 5C). Therefore, the results demonstrate that autophagy induction by rapamycin represses the expression of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and I\u03baB\u03b1 at a transcriptional level by interfering with the IL1\u03b2-p38 MAPK-NF\u03baB feedback loop (Figure 5D).\nFigure 5: Rapamycin inhibits p38 MAPK-NF\u03baB pathway. THP-1-differentiated macrophages were stimulated by LPS (2 \u03bcg/mL, 4 h), followed by ATP (5 mM, 45 min) in the presence or absence of rapamycin (Rapa, 50 nM) or 3-methyl adenine (3-MA, 2.5 mM). At 2 h after ATP stimulation, the cells were assayed. (A) Representative Western blots of p38 MAP kinase (p38) and phospho-p38 (pp38) in cell lysates.

Upon activation by LPS and ATP, IL-1\u03b2 mRNA, pro-IL-1\u03b2 protein, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) are increased inside macrophages, which cooperatively elicit the cleavage of caspase-1 into active form and secrete IL-1\u03b2 outside the cells, i.e. NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Rapamycin induces autophagy, and thus facilitates the autophagic removal of pro-IL-1\u03b2 and mtROS. Additionally, rapamycin causes transcriptional up-regulation of p62/SQSTM1 which potentiates autophagy and activates Nrf2 pathway to further suppress mtROS. The decreased IL-1\u03b2 secretion by rapamycin subsequently reduces activation of IL1-p38 MAPK-NF\u03baB pathway, leading to down-regulation of IL-6, IL-8, I\u03baB, and MCP-1.\nRapamycin, the prototypical inhibitor of mTOR, was originally discovered in soil from Easter Island (locally known as Rapa Nui) as an anti-fungal agent in the 1970s. Since it is increasingly recognized that the mTOR pathway has manifold functions as a central regulator of cell metabolism [6, 40], the mTOR inhibitors including rapamycin are in clinical use as an immunosuppressive treatment to prevent organ transplant rejection [41\u201343] and stent restenosis [44, 45] or as an anti-cancer therapy [46, 47]. In addition, rapamycin, as a strong autophagy inducer, has been shown to increase lifespan of mice [48] and cultured human fibroblasts [29]. However, it is also reported that inhibition of the mTOR pathway with rapamycin has immunostimulatory effects on blood leukocytes from transplant recipients [49, 50] or on mouse myeloid cells after bacterial infection [51, 52]. Given these multiple and contradictory roles of mTOR pathway, it is important to understand the effects of rapamycin depending on the type of cell and its extracellular and intracellular signals for successful application of rapamycin and its analogs in clinic. In this study, we investigated the effects of rapamycin on human monocyte-derived macrophages activated by NLRP3 inflammasome invoking signals.\nMonocytes and macrophages are immune cells that first respond to tissue injury by detecting \u2018danger\u2019 signals and initiating the inflammatory process [2, 53]. Prominent among inflammatory pathways in monocytes/macrophages are caspase-1-activating platforms called \u201cinflammasomes\u201d that control maturation and secretion of interleukins such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, whose potent pro-inflammatory activities direct host response to infection and injury [13]. The NLRP3 inflammasome is the inflammasome best characterized to date, and a tight regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome is essential for preventing long-lasting tissue inflammation and collateral damage as reflected by strong associations between a number of human diseases and dysregulated inflammasome activity [10, 54]. There are cell-autonomous regulatory feedback loops to regulate NLRP3 inflammasome, the most predominant of which is regulation by autophagy. Previous studies have demonstrated that induction of autophagy by inflammatory signals limits NLRP3 inflammasome activation by removing damaged mitochondria and preventing mtROS release [9, 10, 16]. Also, autophagy has been shown to be involved in elimination of ubiquitinated inflammasomes [14] or pro-IL-1\u03b2 molecules [15]. Consistent with these reports, our results indicate that autophagy induction by rapamycin is effective in suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation through the reduction of mtROS and pro-IL-1\u03b2.\nOne interesting finding in our study was that rapamycin upregulated the expression of p62/SQSTM1 in LPS/ATP-treated macrophages, and p62/SQSTM1 played a key role in mediating the rapamycin action in NLRP3 inflammasome suppression. An autophagy adaptor, p62/SQSTM1 has been recently identified as a signaling link that allows the cell to restrain activation of inflammasomes. A recent study by Zhong et al. revealed that NF-\u03baB upregulates p62/SQSTM1 expression in LPS-primed macrophages, which in turn induces mitophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria and thereby attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent IL-1\u03b2 production [17]. Another study by Liu et al. recently demonstrated that tripartite motif 11 (TRIM11) interacts with p62/SQSTM1 to degrade AIM2 inflammasome via selective autophagy [55]. Therefore, these findings support the notion that p62/SQSTM1 mediates a negative regulatory mechanism by which macrophages control their own aberrant activation.\nApart from its role in autophagy and NF-\u03baB signaling, p62/SQSTM1 protects the cell against oxidative stress by facilitating the Keap1\u2013NRF2 pathway and activating the protective antioxidant response [56, 57]. In line with this, we found that rapamycin increased Nrf2 activation in a p62/SQSTM1-dependent manner, and Nrf2 mediated the rapamycin activity in reducing mtROS.\nThe up-regulation of p62/SQSTM1 by rapamycin was previously observed in human fibroblasts [29]. Lerner et al. observed that the mRNA level of p62/SQSTM1 was increased in rapamycin-treated fibroblasts, and the protein level was also elevated by rapamycin starting after 2 h of culture in the presence of lysosomal inhibitors known to block autophagosome. More prominent p62/SQSTM1-positive foci were noted in rapamycin-treated cultures, and p62/SQSTM1 turnover was accelerated by rapamycin. Another study by Sahani et al. showed that prolonged autophagy activation by starvation restored p62/SQSTM1 by transcriptional up-regulation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, suggesting that the expression level of p62/SQSTM1 does not always inversely correlate with autophagic activity [28]. Further study would be necessary to elucidate the mechanism underlying the elevation in p62/SQSTM1 level we observed in rapamycin-treated macrophages.\nAnother noteworthy finding from our study was that rapamycin down-regulated the IL1\u03b2-p38 MAPK-NF\u03baB pathway in macrophages, leading to reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and IL-8. Similar to our findings, Laberge et al. reported that rapamycin decreases NF-\u03baB activity and inhibits transcription and secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 in senescent human fibroblasts by reducing IL-1\u03b1 production [39]. In addition to their roles in inflammation, IL-6 and IL-8 are major components of the so-called senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a typical feature of senescent cells characterized by the release of various cytokines, growth factors, and proteases [58, 59]. Since the SASP contributes to sterile inflammation which is a hallmark of aging and age-related pathologies, it is possible that the activity of rapamycin to suppress IL-6 and IL-8 might reduce inflammation and \u201cinflammaging\u201d [60] either by preventing the conversion of senescent fibroblasts into pro-inflammatory cells or by repressing excessive activation of immune cells including macrophages.\nMacrophages are involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases [4]. Intrinsically, macrophages are well-equipped with multiple mechanisms to control aberrant and prolonged activation. Macrophage modulation by augmenting the cell-intrinsic regulatory mechanisms would represent an attractive strategy to treat or prevent diseases. In that sense, our results might provide a basis for developing potential therapies for diseases that are mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation and autophagy impairment in macrophages, such as atherosclerosis [61], diabetes mellitus [62, 63], Crohn\u2019s disease [64], Alzheimer\u2019s disease [65], uveitis [66] and age-related macular degeneration [67]. The in vivo study to explore the clinical relevance of our findings would help substantiate the implication of autophagy-mediated macrophage modulation for the treatment of diseases.\nCells, reagents, and stimulation\nTHP-1 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and cultured in RPMI (Welgene, Daegu, Korea) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Grand Island, NY) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (PS; Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages by treatment for 3 h with 300 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). 24h later, the cells were stimulated to activate NLRP3 inflammasome.\nFor NLRP3 inflammasome stimulation, THP-1-differentiated macrophages were primed with 2 \u03bcg/mL LPS (Ultra-pure LPS, InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) for 4 h, and then treated with 5 mM ATP (InvivoGen) for 45 min. After the cells were washed with phosphate buffered solution (PBS) three times washing, the cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM (Welgene) with 2% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco) and 1% PS (Lonza) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 until further assays.\nFor treatment, rapamycin (1 to 1000 nM; Sigma-Aldrich), BafA1 (75 nM; Sigma-Aldrich), 3-MA (2.5 mM; Sigma-Aldrich), IL-1ra (1 to 200 ng/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), recombinant human IL-1\u03b2 (1 to 1000 pg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), or SB-208350 (1 to 100 \u03bcM; Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the cultures simultaneously with LPS priming step and maintained until assays.\nRNA-mediated interference\nDifferentiated THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI (Welgene) with 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco) and 1% PS (Lonza) for 24 h. The cells were then transfected with siRNA for p62/SQSTM1 or Nrf2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) or with control siRNA having scrambled sequence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) using a SG cell line 4D-Nucleofector X kit (Lonza) per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. The degree of gene knockdown was determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting after 24 h of transfection, the same time-point when macrophages were stimulated with LPS/ATP. The knockdown efficiencies of p62/SQSTM1 and Nrf2 were 93 \u00b1 0.6% and 81 \u00b1 0.7%, respectively (Supplementary Figure 1).\nReal-time RT-PCR\nFor RNA extraction, the cells were lysed in RNA isolation reagent (RNA Bee, Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX) and homogenized with an ultrasound sonicator (Ultrasonic Processor, Cole Parmer Instruments, Vernon Hills, IL). Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After the amount of RNA was measured using Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo scientific, Waltham, MA), 1 \u03bcg RNA was used to generate cDNA by reverse transcription (High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit, Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Real-time amplification was performed using TaqMan\u00ae Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in ABI 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) for the following molecules: NLRP3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, I\u03baB\u03b1, p62/SQSTM1, Nrf2 and NQO1 (NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1). Human PCR probe sets were commercially purchased (TaqMan\u00ae Gene Expression Assay Kits, Applied Biosystems). Values were normalized to 18s RNA and expressed as fold changes relative to controls.\nMTT assay\nThe cell viability was measured using MTT assay (Cell Counting Kit-8, Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) as per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\nFor protein extraction, the cells were sonicated on ice in RIPA Buffer (Biosesang, Seongnam, Korea) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4\u00baC for 20 min, clear cell lysates were measured for protein concentration by Bradford assay. A total of 20 \u03bcg protein was fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 8\u201316% Tris- glycine gel (Komabiotech, Seoul, Korea), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen), and then blotted with antibodies against LC3 II (1:500), p62/SQSTM1 (1:4000), beclin 1 (1:10000), ATG5 (1:500), Nrf2 (1:1000) (Novus biological, Littleton , USA), pro-IL-1\u03b2 (1:1000), p38 (1:1000), phospho-p38 (pp38, 1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), or \u03b2\u2013actin (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).\nThe cell-free supernatants were collected from cell cultures after centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 20\u00b0C, and assayed for concentrations of human IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 using ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN)\nMultiplex cytokine assay\nThe cell-free supernatants were assayed by Multiplex Luminex\u00ae Assays (Luminex 200 multi-protein analyzer, Luminex, Austin, TX) for the levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and GM-CSF.\nFor cellular and mitochondrial ROS measurements, the cells were stained with both CellROX dye (5 \u03bcM; CellROXTM Deep Red Reagent, Invitrogen) and MitoTracker (MT) Green dye (100 nM; MitoTracker Green FM Dye, Invitrogen) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, and analyzed for fluorescence using S1000EXi Flow Cytometer (Stratedigm, San Jose, CA). The data were analyzed using Flowjo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).\nImmunofluorescent staining\nFor NF-\u03baB translocation assay, THP-1-differentiated macrophages were stimulated with LPS/ATP in the presence or absence of rapamycin as mentioned above. After PBS washing twice, the cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 5 min and incubated with 1 \u03bcg/mL of anti-NF-\u03baB p65 antibody (ab16502, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) in blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin in PBS) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The samples were incubated for 1 h with the anti-rabbit IgG (1:2,000) (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488, Invitrogen). The slides were visualized with a fluorescent microscopy (BX-61, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).\nExperiments were independently performed at least three times, each experiment with at least three samples per group. GraphPad Software (GraphPad Prism\u00ae, Inc., La Jolla, CA) was used for statistical tests. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA to compare means of three or more groups. Tuckey\u2019s Honestly Significant Difference test was used for a follow-up pairwise comparison. The data are presented as the mean +/\u00b1 SD. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.\nARE: antioxidant response element; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; BafA1: bafilomycin A1; FBS: fetal bovine serum; IL-1R: IL-1 receptor; IL-1ra: IL-1 receptor antagonist; Keap1: Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; 3-MA: 3-methyl adenine; MAPK: MAP kinase; MCP-1: monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; MT: MitoTracker; mtROS: mitochondrial reactive oxygen species; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; mTORC1: mTOR complex 1; MTT: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Nrf2: nuclear factor erythroid-derived-2-like 2; PBS: phosphate buffered solution; PMA: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; Pp38: phospho-p38 MAPK; PS: penicillin-streptomycin; SASP: senescence-associated secretory phenotype; TRIM11: tripartite motif 11.\nJ.H.K. conceived and performed experiments, and wrote the manuscript.

However, those that decide to head north from Lima are rarely disappointed.\nArchaeological sites litter the landscape. Some, little more than sunbaked mud hills at first glance, have revealed treasure-laden tombs that are among the richest in the world. Others spread for several square miles and comprise dozens of pyramids or massive mud walls extensively decorated with carved reliefs; some sit atop cloud-covered mountain tops or covered by the all-consuming jungle.\nArchaeologists are certain that many more sites lie waiting to be uncovered.\nIt is this ongoing sense of discovery that makes exploring Northern Peru exciting and fascinating. In 1987, archaeologists digging in Sipan, near Chiclayo, discovered the richest burial ever found in South America. Since then they have uncovered more tombs at the same site.\nMeanwhile, carbon dating undertaken in 2001 at the newly-excavated site of Caral, near Barranco, yielded an unexpected surprise - a city that dates back nearly five millennia, one thousand years older than any other South American city.\nAnd in 2006, archaeologists working at El Brujo, near Trujillo, found a 1,500-year-old burial of a tattooed woman, the first example of a major entombment of an upper-class female. You never know what may be discovered next!\nFurther north, Piura is surrounded by villages that are known for their handicrafts and is gateway to both the most important centre of shamanism in Peru \u2026 the beaches of the north coast. These offer arguably the best places in Peru to surf and sun-worship, two activities that date back thousands of years.\nHeading inland, what Peru\u2019s northernmost Andes lack in elevation, they more than make up for with dramatic history and an exciting environment of barely-penetrated cloud forests.\nCajamarca, one of the gateways to the region, is famed for its Inca baths, where Atahualpa relaxed in 1532 during his final days of freedom before being captured, imprisoned, ransomed for a room full of gold and two rooms of silver, and finally executed by the Spanish conquistadors.\nThe northern highlands are cleaved by the Mara\u00f1on River, one of Peru\u2019s major tributaries to the Amazon. The Mara\u00f1on winds its way through the Department of Amazonas, but the capital of the department, Chachapoyas, stands at a distinctly non-Amazonian elevation of 2,335 m (7,661 ft).\nTraveling overland east of Cajamarca to Chachapoyas, via Celendin and Leymebamba, is a heady experience, descending on a one-track road into the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n valley and then climbing into a rugged, and little-explored region of cloud-forest covered highlands.\nThe Chachapoya were another little-understood, pre-Inca culture that left a fascinating archaeological footprint of massive citadels and cities in the northern highlands.\nThe best known is stupendous Kuelap, which rivals Machu Picchu for sheer size and scenery \u2026 but receives a fraction of the visitors, despite the recent construction of an access cable car.\nBeyond Kuelap, there are scores of other archaeological sites, some of which hold amazing tombs built impossibly high on sheer cliffs. Undoubtedly, many more Chachapoya sites wait to be rediscovered.\nWell off the beaten path, the northern highlands are begging to be explored by travellers!\nDescending from Andes to Amazon, there are a range of ecosystems that reflect the change in altitude and climate: Andean puna gives way to Elfin and Cloud Forest, and finally subtropical forest in the lower Andean foothills.\nWithin this transitional zone, there are small, but important cities boasting plentiful flora and fauna.

{"text": "This week on Unorthodox, we\u2019re still trying to find those Holocaust centers Sean Spicer was talking about.\nOur Jewish guest is filmmaker Ferne Pearlstein, whose latest documentary, The Last Laugh, asks comedians like Mel Brooks and Sarah Silverman whether or not we can joke about the Holocaust. She tells us why she decided to tackle such a taboo topic, how gallows humor can be a survival mechanism, and whether it matters if the joke-teller is Jewish or not. The Last Laugh premieres Monday, April 24 on Independent Lens on PBS.\nOur Gentile of the Week is Ashley McKinless, associate editor at America magazine, the Jesuit Review of Faith and Culture. She co-hosts the new podcast Jesuitical, which we lovingly call the Catholic version of Unorthodox. She explains who the Jesuits are, tells us about life as a 20-something practicing Catholic in New York City, and confirms that Liel is the only Leibovitz currently subscribed to America magazine.\nThis episode is also brought to you by PJ Library, a free book program for families raising Jewish children. Sign up at pjlibrary.org/unorthodox, and they\u2019ll send you a free picture book each month until your child turns nine."}
